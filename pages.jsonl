{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 5, "text": "I \nDeutsche Bank  \nLetter from the Chief Executive Officer \nAnnual Report 2024 \nLetter from the Chief Executive Officer \nDear Shareholders, \nOnce again, we look back on another eventful year – and once again we can say at the end of the year that Deutsche Bank \nsuccessfully mastered these challenges. We showed resilience in 2024 when we faced unexpected headwinds. We clearly \ndemonstrated the operational strength of our bank, reported the highest revenues since 2015 and continued to invest, \nthereby laying the groundwork for continued growth along this trajectory in the years to come.  \nIn support of this, across the entire bank, we reflected last year in depth on who we are, what we want to achieve for our \nclients and our shareholders and how to get there. We defined a common identity, we gave thought to the kind of culture \nwe strive for in order to be able to excel together every day; and we formulated our purpose that commits everyone in the \nbank to the lasting success and financial security of our clients at home and abroad. This purpose underpins what we want \nto stand for as a Global Hausbank: we want to place our clients firmly at the centre of all we do and engage with them in \nlasting, trusting partnerships in which we both grow and develop. \nWe are convinced that our expertise and our solutions will be highly sought after in the current difficult geopolitical and \neconomic environment. This was already clear in 2024 and is reflected in our revenue growth: year on year, revenues were \nup 4% to € 30.1 billion. That is the fifth annual increase in a row. We grew faster than the market in key areas, gaining market \nshare. And we are seeing our targeted investments in our core strengths paying off more and more. \nOur operational strength is also reflected in our full-year profit. Compared to 2023, pre-tax profit fell by 7% to € 5.3 billion. \nHowever, if you exclude costs that are not directly related to business operations, profit before tax rose to € 7.9 billion. \nThe considerable increase in nonoperating costs, which – at € 2.6 billion – more than doubled compared to 2023, was \nmainly due to roughly € 2 billion in litigation costs, which we absorbed in 2024. The consequence was an overall 6% year-\non-year increase in noninterest expenses to € 23 billion. \nThis should not obscure our continued discipline when it comes to expenses. Adjusted costs for the full year were 1% lower \nthan in the previous year, despite persistent inflation and some specific items in the fourth quarter of last year, and despite \nour investments in our business and controls. In 2024, we hired 1,300 technology specialists and added 400 targeted client \nfacing roles, supporting cost improvement and growth. We also invested a further € 1.2 billion in controls, taking the total \nsince 2019 to more than € 6.5 billion. \nOur capital position was also strong in 2024, with our CET1 ratio at the end of last year at 13.8% despite legal cases over \nthe course of the year weighing on it. That is also excellent news for you, our shareholders, as it gives us scope to increase \nour distributions to you as planned. We will propose a dividend of 68 cents per share to the Annual General Meeting on \nMay 22, 2025. This is, as promised, a 50% increase on last year. Furthermore, we are buying back additional shares worth \n€ 750 million. Taken together, we intend to initially distribute € 2.1 billion in 2025. And we will look to do even more for \nyou consistent with our performance. We have our sights firmly set on our commitment to distribute a total of at least \n€ 8 billion for the five-year period 2021 to 2025 and are confident that we will exceed this target. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 6, "text": "II \n \nDeutsche Bank  \nLetter from the Chief Executive Officer \nAnnual Report 2024 \nGrowth in the business divisions in 2024 \nA glance at our business divisions shows that our operational strength is very solid and broad-based. Once again, 2024 saw \neach of our four businesses contributing a significant share of the bank’s revenues, with around three quarters coming from \nmore predictable business areas. In a stabilizing interest rate environment, we further reduced our dependence on interest \nincome. Net interest income accounts for only 43% of the bank’s total revenues, which is exactly how we planned it.   \nSpecifically, the four businesses developed as follows: \nIn the Corporate Bank, revenues fell by 3% to € 7.5 billion but remained at a very high level after an increase of more than \n20% in the previous year. As expected, deposit margins normalized in the wake of the changed interest rate environment. \nHowever, the division was able to largely offset this through annual growth of 5% in net commissions and fee income, and \nby increasing deposit volumes by 8%. \nThe Investment Bank's revenues rose 15% to € 10.6 billion in 2024. One driving factor here was the 9% increase in revenues \nin our Fixed Income & Currencies (FIC) business. Our strategic investments in recent years paid off here, as well as in the \nOrigination & Advisory business, where revenues were 61% higher than in the previous year.  \nDespite the stabilization in the interest rate environment, revenues in our Private Bank fell only slightly year on year to \n€ 9.4 billion. Net interest income decreased by 6%, partially offset by growth in deposit revenues in Personal Banking. \nAssets under management rose by € 55 billion to € 633 billion in 2024 – their highest ever – with net inflows of € 29 billion \nbeing a key driver. We have thus laid a strong foundation for additional revenues in the future.  \nThe same is true for Asset Management, where revenues increased by 11% to € 2.6 billion in 2024. Assets under \nmanagement grew by € 115 billion, exceeding € 1 trillion for the first time. This included net inflows of € 26 billion, notably \nthanks to our growing business with passive investment products (X-trackers). Overall, management fees increased by 7% \nto € 2.5 billion, while performance and transaction fees rose by 16% to € 148 million.  \nSustainability remains a top management priority \nA focus in all four businesses in 2024 was once again our intensive dialogue with clients on their transition to a more \nsustainable business. It is undisputed that transforming the global economy in this way requires massive investments – not \nonly because we have to combat climate change, but also because companies and financial service providers must protect \ntheir own business models from risks associated with the anticipated rise in global temperatures. That is why sustainability \nremains a top management priority for us at Deutsche Bank. We continue to pursue our sustainability goals and our net-\nzero commitment. \n2024 was a particularly good year for us from a sustainability perspective. We facilitated € 93 billion in sustainable \nfinancing and ESG investment volumes, the second-highest volume since we started measuring in 2020. At the same time, \nwe have refined our approach to reducing the emissions we finance with our corporate loans. We have defined net-zero \ntargets for eight carbon-intensive industries in the bank’s corporate loan book by the end of 2050. The most recent addition \nwas the aviation industry.  \nOur progress not only in the area of the environment, but also in terms of social performance indicators and corporate \ngovernance was recognized by five leading agencies during the year. For example, our Corporate Sustainability \nAssessment from S&P Global Sustainable scored 67 out of 100 points, up from 54 in the previous year. In addition, \nDeutsche Bank returned to the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) World and DJSI Europe at the end of \nDecember. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 7, "text": "III \n \nDeutsche Bank  \nLetter from the Chief Executive Officer \nAnnual Report 2024 \nFighting financial crime is becoming increasingly urgent \nClimate risks are just one kind of a number of non-financial risks that our bank must manage. Another is the continuously \ngrowing threat from financial criminals.  To counter these threats, we must continuously expand our expertise in the fight \nagainst financial crime and constantly improve our defense systems and controls.  \nOver the past year, we have again made significant progress in this area and are in close dialogue with our regulators to \nremediate any remaining shortcomings. Deutsche Bank's senior leadership team is devoting its utmost attention to this \ntask.  \nIn order to prevent misconduct and avert threats from criminals, the expertise and cooperation of all colleagues at \nDeutsche Bank is crucial. That is why we invest not only in systems, but also in regular learning opportunities for staff. With \nactivities in almost 60 countries, we employ people with a whole range of different profiles, backgrounds and skills – to \nour bank’s advantage.  \nThis diversity benefits us in many areas of our business. That is why we remain committed to a fair and inclusive workplace. \nOf course, we will also make sure to always act in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations all over the world and \ntake into consideration how they evolve.  \nIt is our outstanding employees that make our bank successful, today and in the future. That is why we invest in their \neducation and training and in a working environment that motivates them to perform at their best. Together, we are all \nworking towards being the bank we want to be and achieving the goal we are all aiming for: to be the European champion \nand first choice for our clients. \nOutlook: ideally positioned for future success – in 2025 and beyond \nWe have the prerequisites to achieve this goal. In a geopolitical environment that is likely to remain volatile and \ncharacterized by conflicts for some time to come, we can play to our strengths as a Global Hausbank. And with the \nsuccessful work in the transition year of 2024, in which we put significant legacy issues behind us and made our bank even \nmore robust, we have started 2025 in a position of strength.  \nThis is a crucial milestone on our path. At the end of the year, we will be judged by whether we have been successful with \nour transformation and growth strategy. The key measure of this is our return on tangible equity, and we are convinced \nthat we will increase this to over 10% this year, as planned, by increasing revenues to around € 32 billion and maintaining \nour cost discipline. We expect our nonoperating costs to be significantly lower in 2025. We intend to keep adjusted costs \nessentially stable at the prior-year level by financing further investments in our business through our announced efficiency \nmeasures. And while we now target a slightly higher cost/income ratio of below 65% at the end of this year, our focus on \ncost control remains undiminished.  \nThat said, 2025 is not just the year in which we must prove ourselves. It is also the year in which we want to lay the \nfoundations for realizing our ambitions in the years to come – in terms of revenues, profits, distributions to our shareholders \nand, above all, in terms of the strength and quality of our client offering.  \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 8, "text": "IV \n \nDeutsche Bank  \nLetter from the Chief Executive Officer \nAnnual Report 2024 \nWe are convinced that from our position we can achieve much more if we further sharpen our business profile and carry \non working on becoming more efficient. Two aspects are in special focus: \n– We will continue to optimize our operating model and organizational structures, to make our processes, decision-\nmaking and controls even more efficient, while at the same time offering our clients an even better banking experience. \nTechnologies such as artificial intelligence and automation can play an important role if we adapt them even faster and\nuse them to create innovative products for our clients. In addition, as a result of the successful transformation of recent \nyears, our bank has now reached a level of maturity that allows us to hand over more responsibility to the businesses.\nThis is something else that will make us more efficient.\n– In the future, we will allocate capital in precisely those areas where it creates the greatest value. We are already \ngenerating very good returns in many areas of our bank. However, scope exists for us to continue to sharpen our focus\non our strengths while at the same time assessing even more rigorously whether it makes sense to redistribute parts of\nthe capital invested or even give up one or the other area to make better use of our resources elsewhere. This will involve \nevaluating all businesses and all teams more consistently and measuring them by the Shareholder Value Add they\ncreate.\nThe Management Board has a clear agenda, and we have already started taking measures to implement it and better exploit \nour great potential in the future. We can further improve our client offering and create additional revenue opportunities. \nIn combination with further efficiency gains, this creates the scope for a return on tangible equity that clearly exceeds the \n2025 target of more than 10%. This will enable us to continually increase distributions and make our shares more attractive \nto investors.  \nWe are determined to seize these opportunities: for our clients, for our employees and for you, our shareholders. This is \nwhat we do every day – with deep dedication.  \nThank you for placing your trust in Deutsche Bank. \nKind regards,  \nChristian Sewing \n"}

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 10, "text": "VI \n \nDeutsche Bank  \nLetter from the Chairman of the Supervisory Board \nAnnual Report 2024 \nLetter from the Chairman of the Supervisory Board \nDear Shareholders, \nLast year, Deutsche Bank continued to make solid progress in an uncertain and volatile environment. We achieved strong \noperating results and important strategic milestones. As a result of the continued positive momentum in all four \nbusinesses, revenues exceeded € 30 billion. We have built strong positions in the business segments on which we focus, \ngiving us a strong basis for further growth. Our clients value the advice and solutions that we offer them as a Global \nHausbank, at home and abroad.  \nAs a Supervisory Board, we have closely monitored the development of the Bank and worked with the Management Board \non key issues including capital allocation, management of financial and non-financial risks and efficiency measures. We \npaid particular attention to sustainably strengthening profitability to achieve the Bank's growth targets. We also had to \ndeal with litigation costs of almost € 2 billion, contributing to an extraordinarily high level of non-operating costs; at the \nsame time this means that the bank has significantly improved its risk profile.  \nA significant milestone was the rollout of our framework \"This is Deutsche Bank\", including a clear purpose which \nunderlines that clients’ lasting success and financial security are always at the center of everything we do. The framework \ncovers our entire strategy and our aspirational corporate culture and underlines our ambition to be a reliable partner who \noffers our clients tailor-made solutions for the challenges they face. The Supervisory Board has been closely involved in \nthis process and will continue to be as we further anchor our purpose and culture in the day-to-day work of our employees \nand the strategic development of the bank. We are convinced this is the best way to create sustainable value for you, our \nshareholders.  \nAn even stronger focus on continued success is also reflected in the new compensation system for the Management Board, \nwhich was backed by a large majority of the Annual General Meeting last year and was applied for the first time in 2024. \nThe number of targets and metrics has been significantly reduced, and the long-term component of variable compensation \nwill no longer be measured by the results of previous years; instead, the new system looks forward, at how performance \nagainst both financial and ESG goals develops over the next three years. At the same time, we have made the system more \ntransparent and simpler, especially when it comes to short-term goals. Applying the new remuneration system for the first \ntime this year proves that it leads to good results.  \nThe Supervisory Board also decided on two changes to the Management Board last year. In July, Laura Padovani was \nappointed as the new Chief Compliance and Anti-Financial Crime Officer in order to continue to develop the bank's \ncontrols, which have already been strengthened in recent years. In December, we appointed Marcus Chromik as the new \nChief Risk Officer, succeeding Olivier Vigneron whose contract expires in May 2025. We pay attention to the right \ncombination of knowledge, skills and experience among the board members. At the same time, the Supervisory Board is \nactively working to create a diverse Management Board in terms of gender, nationality, age and background. It is \nparticularly important to us to increase the share of women in leadership positions, both on the Management Board and at \nthe levels below, whilst ensuring compliance with the laws and regulations in all of the markets in which we operate.  \nDecisive progress has also been made in the areas of digitalization and regulatory requirements, which the Supervisory \nBoard has supported as part of its mandate. The bank has continued to advance its IT modernization, both to increase \nefficiency and security, and to adapt to new or growing cybersecurity threats. At the same time, new regulatory \nrequirements were successfully implemented. In our Strategy and Sustainability Committee, we focused on strategic \nprogress and the bank's sustainability strategy, which remains an important element of our business model.  \nI would like to take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues on the Supervisory Board for their commitment and \nprofessional cooperation, especially my deputies Frank Schulze and Norbert Winkeljohann. Last year, there was only one \nchange in our Supervisory Board: in January 2024, Birgit Laumen resigned from her mandate, whereupon Florian \nHaggenmiller was appointed by the court as her successor. We will inform you about the upcoming elections for \nshareholder representatives this year when we publish the agenda for our Annual General Meeting. Like many other \ncompanies in the German DAX index, we will hold the latter virtually again this year; this will give as many shareholders as \npossible the opportunity to participate, regardless of their location. In response to shareholders’ requests, we have \namended the virtual format of the AGM, allowing all questions to be asked live during the event. Further details will follow \nwhen the Annual General Meeting is officially convened.  \n"}

It reported to us on the financial development, earnings and risk situation, the bank’s \nliquidity, capital and risk management, the technical and organizational resources as well as business transactions and \nevents that were of significant importance to the bank. We were involved in decisions of fundamental importance to the \nbank. As in previous years, the Management Board provided us, in accordance with our requests, with enhanced reporting \non several topic areas, for example: The strategic development, the combating of financial crime and the ongoing \ndevelopment of the related controls, the bank’s capitalization, the progress in remediating regulatory enforcement actions \nand the related critical findings, as well as important interactions with various regulators. The Management Board reported \nto us on the sustainability strategy and reporting pursuant to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) as \nwell as progress on the transitional plan for the loan book for CO2-intensive sectors. Non-financial risks and opportunities \nwere also covered. \nIn addition to regulatory issues, the Supervisory Board continued to focus on the Private Bank, in particular with regard to \nits progress on and measures to improve the customer service. Furthermore, promoting a diverse Management Board and \nworkforce was very important to the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board regrets the unexpected and unfavorable \ndevelopment of the litigation in the legacy Postbank takeover matter dating back to 2010. The negative decision of the \nHigher Regional Court of Cologne resulted in significant, unforeseen litigation costs in 2024. The Supervisory Board \nacknowledges the dedication and efforts of the current Management Board in achieving a meaningful settlement of these \nlegal disputes with many plaintiffs, thereby mitigating the impact of this legacy matter on the financial results. \nThe Supervisory Board Chairman and the committee chairs regularly had discussions with the Management Board between \nthe meetings. They also consulted each other on the meeting agendas for the respective committees they chair and \ndiscussed topics of overarching importance for the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, upcoming decisions were deliberated \non and prepared in discussions conducted regularly between the Management Board and the Chairman of the Supervisory \nBoard as well as the chairs of the Supervisory Board committees. In addition, the Management Board invited us to an \ninformation event on current topics. Characteristic for our cooperation with the Management Board was our focus on \nworking together responsibly in a spirit of mutual trust for the successful further development of the company. \nThere were a total of 55 meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees. These were conducted as meetings with \nphysical attendance, as video conferences or as hybrid meetings (with both on-site and virtual participation). When \nmeetings were convened as video conferences, a room was also available for all members to participate on the bank’s \npremises. Between the meetings, resolutions were adopted, when necessary, through circulation voting procedure.  \nMeetings of the Supervisory Board \nWe held a total of eight meetings, including six regularly scheduled meetings.

At its meetings, the Committee addressed in particular the \nmonitoring of the design of the compensation systems of the Management Board and employees and, together with the \nRisk Committee, assessed the effects of the compensation systems and variable compensation for the 2024 financial year \non the risk, capital and liquidity situation.

In light of the personnel-related changes on the Management Board, the \nCommittee also addressed the corresponding adjustment of the individual objectives. Furthermore, it dealt with regulatory \ndevelopments and regulatory findings on compensation topics and addressed, also with the support of external advisors, \nthe examination of the existence of the preconditions for the suspension, forfeiture or claw-back of elements of variable \ncompensation of (former) members of the Management Board.

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 25, "text": "XXI \n \nDeutsche Bank  \nStrategy \nAnnual Report 2024 \nStrategy \nGlobal Hausbank \nDeutsche Bank’s strategic and financial roadmap through 2025 aims to position Deutsche Bank as a Global Hausbank, \ndedicated to its clients’ lasting success and financial security at home and abroad, and to achieve the bank’s 2025 financial \ntargets and capital objectives. The Global Hausbank strategy is underpinned by three key themes: risk management, \nsustainability and technology, all of which have become even more important considering the ongoing geopolitical and \nmacroeconomic challenges. \nDeutsche Bank’s key performance indicators 2025 \nFinancial targets and capital objectives for 2025 \nFinancial targets: \n– Post-tax Return on Average Tangible Equity of above 10% for the Group \n– Compound annual growth rate of revenues between 2021 and 2025 of 5.5% to 6.5%\n– Cost/income ratio of below 65% (reset from below 62.5%) \nCapital objectives: \n– Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of approximately 13% \n– 50% Total payout ratio from 2025\nDeutsche Bank reaffirms its financial targets, including the cost/income ratio target which has been reset from below \n62.5% to below 65% at the beginning of 2025, as well as its capital objectives for 2025. All forward-looking projections \nbelow are based on January 31, 2025, foreign exchange rates. \nPost-tax Return on Average Tangible Equity and adjusted costs are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to \n“Supplementary financial information (Unaudited): Non-GAAP financial measures” of this report for the definitions of such \nmeasures and reconciliations to the IFRS numbers on which they are based.  \nProgress on strategy implementation \nIn 2024, Deutsche Bank made progress across all dimensions of its accelerated Global Hausbank strategy through \ndisciplined execution, driving revenue growth as well as operational and capital efficiency. The bank maintained tight \ndiscipline on adjusted costs while continuing to invest in the bank’s platform. Moreover, the bank put specific legacy \nlitigation costs and exceptional other items behind it. \nOn revenue growth, net revenues grew to € 30.1 billion in 2024, up from € 28.9 billion, or 4%, versus 2023, in line with the \nbank’s guidance of around € 30 billion for 2024. Compound annual revenue growth since 2021 was 5.8% through the end \nof 2024, compared to 6.6% in 2023, in line with the bank’s target range of 5.5% to 6.5%. In 2025, the bank expects continued \nfranchise momentum and growth potential across all its businesses to drive revenue growth supported by investments \nunder the bank’s efficiency programs. This growth is expected to result from both net interest income and noninterest \nincome, reflecting the bank's diversified business mix which allows around 75% of the expected revenues to come from \nmore predictable revenue streams. Deutsche Bank confirms its revenue goal of around € 32 billion at Group level in 2025, \nwhich translates to around € 32.7 billion at January 2025 foreign exchange rates. \nNoninterest expenses in 2024 were € 23.0 billion, up from € 21.7 billion, or 6%, versus the prior year, and included \n€ 2.6 billion in nonoperating costs relating to litigation as well as restructuring and severance charges. Adjusted costs were \n€ 20.4 billion in 2024, down from € 20.6 billion, or 1% compared to the prior year. Deutsche Bank made further progress \non its € 2.5 billion operational efficiency program during 2024. Measures included the optimization of the bank’s platform \nin Germany, workforce reductions, notably in non-client-facing roles, IT and infrastructure optimization along with a \ncontinued automation of front-to-back processes. The bank expects the large majority of these measures to positively \nimpact the adjusted cost run-rate in 2025. Nonoperating costs in 2025 are expected to decrease as litigation as well as \nrestructuring and severance charges are expected to normalize. As a result, the bank now targets a cost/income ratio of \nbelow 65% in 2025, marginally higher than the original target, to support further growth and business momentum in and \nbeyond 2025.  \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 26, "text": "XXII \n \nDeutsche Bank  \nStrategy \nAnnual Report 2024 \nOn capital efficiency, Deutsche Bank’s capital efficiency program has delivered cumulative RWA-equivalent reductions of \n€ 24 billion, close to its target range of € 25 to € 30 billion by the end of 2025. The bank aims to reach the higher end of its \ntarget range by year end 2025. Capital efficiencies contributed to the bank’s year end 2024 CET1 ratio of 13.8%, which \nincludes the € 750 million share repurchases authorized for 2025. The bank plans to continue progressing on capital \nefficiencies in 2025.  \nDeutsche Bank announced plans for € 2.1 billion in further capital distributions to shareholders in 2025. The bank has \nreceived supervisory authorization for further share repurchases of € 750 million and plans to propose 2024 dividends of \n€ 1.3 billion, or € 0.68 per share, at its Annual General Meeting in May 2025, up 50% from € 0.45 per share for 2023. These \nmeasures would increase cumulative capital distributions to shareholders to € 5.4 billion since 2022, in excess of the \n€ 5 billion goal in the bank’s transformation program launched in 2019. The bank reaffirms its ambition to exceed its capital \ndistribution goal of € 8 billion in respect of the financial years 2021-2025, to be paid in 2022-2026. Deutsche Bank will \ncontinue to target a payout ratio of 50% after 2025 through share buybacks and cash dividends, with cash dividends \ngrowing more moderately compared to increases seen in recent years. \nDriving the next phase of Deutsche Bank’s evolution \nLooking beyond 2025, Deutsche Bank already started to work on its next phase of evolution and implement measures to \nbring the bank to the next level of performance, aiming for an even more balanced earnings profile and for a more \ntechnology-driven business with the bank’s customers with a leaner infrastructure.  \nDeutsche Bank aims to further increase shareholder value by sharpening its focus on capital allocation and the \noptimization of RWA at both the business and client level. The bank sees potential for further revenue growth in the \ncontinued improvement of resource productivity across the portfolio through pricing and reallocating capital to high-\nreturn franchises. In addition, the bank strives to improve profitability of lower-return businesses through front-to-back \nefficiency improvements and capital efficiency measures. A reduction in allocated capital and potential selected exits may \nbe considered for areas where return improvements cannot be achieved. Deutsche Bank also plans to re-engineer its target \noperating model, enabling the bank to run its platform on a lower headcount and simplifying the organizational structure. \nThese measures coupled with further front-to-back streamlining of processes, are expected to drive operational efficiency.  \nDeutsche Bank’s next phase also includes a management agenda which emphasizes strengthening risk management and \naccountability and evolving its culture through a purpose-led framework called \"This is Deutsche Bank\". With investments, \nthe bank believes that it is well-positioned to grow the Global Hausbank model, make it more efficient and generate more \ncapital for deployment to the businesses and shareholder distributions.  \nDeutsche Bank plans to provide more details on its strategic aspiration and actions beyond 2025 in due course. \nSustainability \nSustainability has been a fundamental aspect of Deutsche Bank’s strategy since 2019. In 2024, the bank continued to \nfocus on the four pillars of its sustainability strategy: Sustainable Finance, Policies & Commitments, People & Own \nOperations, and Thought Leadership & Stakeholder Engagement.  \nDeutsche Bank set ambitious targets to maximize its contribution to achieving the Paris Climate Agreement’s targets and \nthe United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals. The key targets related to sustainability matters are as follows:  \n– The bank aims to achieve cumulative sustainable financing and investment volumes of € 500 billion from January 2020\nto the end of 2025 (excluding DWS)\n– Deutsche Bank is committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. To this end, the bank has set net-zero targets for\neight carbon-intensive sectors in its corporate loan book, with interim goals by end of 2030 and final targets by end of \n2050 \n– The bank plans to source 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025\n– Following the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) to set targets for the representation of women \non the two management levels below the MB, Deutsche Bank aims to have women representing at least 35% of\nManaging Director, Director and Vice President roles by 2025 \n"}

Corporate Bank’s capabilities in Cash Management, \nTrade Finance and Lending in close collaboration with Foreign Exchange in the Investment Bank enable the business \nsegment to serve the core needs of its clients. As a leading bank serving multinational and German corporates domestically \nand abroad (source: EUROMONEY), the Corporate Bank helps clients in optimizing their working capital and liquidity, \nsecuring global supply chains and distribution channels and managing their risks. Furthermore, Corporate Bank acts as a \nspecialized provider of services to financial institutions, offering Correspondent Banking, Trust and Agency Services as \nwell as Securities Services. Finally, the business segment provides Business Banking services to small corporate and \nentrepreneur clients in Germany through a standardized product suite. \nCorporate Bank has defined a number of specific initiatives to capitalize on its core competencies across these different \nareas to grow revenues to achieve its targets. In particular, the business segment’s investments in new initiatives and \nexperience in managing complex situations for clients, such as uncertainties associated with increasing geopolitical \ntensions, lower economic growth in some of the major operating countries as well as uncertainty around central bank \npolicies, allow Corporate Bank to provide its advisory and solution services. \nIn 2024, Corporate Bank continued to make progress on the business segment’s strategic objectives, notably growing \ncommissions and fee income across all regions. Net interest income in deposit businesses remained resilient as ongoing \ndeposit margin normalization was partly offset by higher deposit volumes and interest hedging. Corporate Bank has been \nawarded “World’s Best Bank for Corporates” in the Euromoney’s Awards for Excellence 2024 and also named “Best Bank \nfor Corporates in Germany”. Additionally, Corporate Bank Germany was recognized by the 2024 FINANCE magazine survey \nas the best bank in corporate banking, number one Hausbank, number one in Cash Management/Payment Transactions \nand in Trade and Export Finance. The segment believes that these awards are a recognition of Corporate Bank’s deep client \nrelationships and client centric solution offering. \nLooking ahead, Corporate Bank is expected to continue to act as an integral part of the Global Hausbank strategy and \ncontribute to Deutsche Bank’s 2025 objectives. The segment sees growth opportunities across all core client groups – \nCorporate, Institutional and Business Banking – both from existing Corporate Bank strengths and from new products. \nCorporate Bank aims to offer a full range of advisory and financing solutions for corporate treasurers and seeks to remain \nthe trusted partner for the German economy, building on its standing as the leading Corporate Bank in its home market. \nThe segment is also committed to connect financial institutions worldwide, a business where it is one of the market leaders \n(source: SWIFT Euro peer benchmarking). The segment's global network across 140 countries combined with profound \nlocal knowledge, a comprehensive product suite and tailored client offering, is expected to continue to offer competitive \nadvantages versus the business segment’s peers. \nAs a transition partner, Corporate Bank seeks to help its clients across sector value chains to achieve their strategic goals \nby offering a broad suite of sustainable finance solutions and sector-aligned sustainability industry expertise. Also, \nCorporate Bank aims to enable the accelerated renewables and infrastructure build-out through its asset and project \nfinance capabilities for emerging energy transformation sectors such as hydrogen, carbon capture, and battery and \nstorage solutions, and the build-out of financing capabilities, driving energy efficiency transformation. \nCorporate Bank’s initiatives will target revenue growth with corporate clients across Cash Management and Trade Finance \nand Lending, including growing its fee-based business with institutional clients and expanding Securities and Trust and \nAgency Services business.  \nAs the segment seeks to grow its business with clients globally, Corporate Bank commits to apply sound risk management \nprinciples to maintain its high-quality loan portfolio and strict lending standards. Equally, the segment commits to \ncontinued cost discipline supported by technology and front-to-back process optimization as well as automation and \nlocation strategy and further investments to support business growth in 2025 and beyond. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 30, "text": "XXVI \n \nDeutsche Bank  \nStrategy \nAnnual Report 2024 \nInvestment Bank \nThe Investment Bank is a key pillar of Deutsche Bank’s business. Across Fixed Income & Currencies (FIC) and Origination & \nAdvisory (O&A), corporate and institutional clients are offered a comprehensive range of services encompassing financing, \nmarket making/liquidity provision, risk management solutions, advisory, and debt & equity issuance. The business segment \nregionally encompasses Europe, Americas, and APAC/MEA. \nIn 2024, the Investment Bank delivered robust performance, with a revenue increase of 15% compared to 2023, while \nmaterially growing return on equity for the business segment. This performance reflects the execution of strategic \npriorities, enhancing the service offering for clients and building on the franchise development over the recent years. \nO&A market fee pools materially improved in 2024, with year-on-year growth of approximately 25%. This, combined with \nthe benefits of significant investments into the platform throughout 2023, drove market share gains across the core \nbusinesses within O&A (source: Dealogic). As the strategic senior hires further embed into our existing businesses, \nproductivity continues to improve and hence further revenue share growth is expected in 2025 and beyond. This will be \nsupported by the Client Strategy and Analytics team, which has strengthened client relationships via a re-tiering exercise \nacross the entire client-base, ensuring the capacity to closely monitor performance at the most granular level, as the \nmarket develops into 2025. \nA continued focus on developing the depth of client relationships, while investing across the platform particularly in the \nU.S., has led to a continuation of the FIC franchise development. The longer-term trend of revenue and market share\ngrowth has been extended. A mature and diversified platform is in place to meet the requirements of the client base. This\nis exemplified by multiple instances of developments across the business, e.g., the launch of HausFX, bringing the FIC suite \nof workflow solutions together and providing clients with the ability to simplify operational activity associated with FX\nexecution. Investment in technology enables both the provision of enhancements to the client offering and the\ndevelopment of more efficient internal processes, ensuring optimized marginal cost of delivery as revenues grow.\nIn 2025, the strategy of the Investment Bank is focused on being the leading non-U.S. global investment bank. The segment \nbelieves continued benefits from prior investments, along with further areas of targeted investment, will enable an \nenhanced offering to clients, further deepening relationships. The result will be a more diversified business – which \nemphasizes capital efficiency and cost discipline, driving shareholder returns.  \nAs the O&A franchise evolves, the segment anticipates that a diversification of revenues will see the proportion of strategic \nadvisory revenues as a percentage of total revenues increase. This will be driven in particular by the development of the \nM&A franchise. The segment expects this, combined with the well-established Debt origination offering, and the expected \nimprovement in Equity Origination to drive further revenue growth. Within FIC, the existing strategy continues – advancing \nexisting and adjacent businesses, the Americas, the depth and breadth of client relationships, and a leading Financing \nfranchise. As with O&A, this is expected to underpin the growth ambition of the business and, combined with a focus upon \nthe efficiency of the operating model, is expected to drive operating leverage. Resources are expected to continue to be \nallocated to the areas of highest return where a competitive advantage has been identified. Across the Investment Bank, \na dedicated client centricity program has been established to optimize resource allocation, with a view to identifying \nfurther areas of collaboration with other business segments, ensuring clients are delivered the full suite of Deutsche Bank’s \nproduct offering. \nFinally, sustainability remains a priority across the Investment Bank, as the business segment continues supporting its \nclients globally. During 2024, Deutsche Bank acted as Joint Lead Manager on KfW’s € 3 billion five-year green bond, the \nproceeds of which will be used to finance new eligible Green Projects. Additionally, the bank served as joint bookrunner \non the Republic of Colombia’s U.S.$ 1.3 billion re-opening of Social U.S.$ Notes due in 2035 and 2053 under its Green, \nSocial and Sustainable Bond Framework. Colombia became the second Latin America sovereign issuer to access the \ninternational capital markets with an ESG-labeled bond in 2024. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 31, "text": " \nXXVII \n \nDeutsche Bank  \nStrategy \nAnnual Report 2024 \nPrivate Bank \nIn 2024, Private Bank reshaped its business along two core client sectors, Personal Banking and Wealth Management & \nPrivate Banking, reinforcing its long-term dedication to a customer-centric strategy. This setup enables more targeted \nclient service, sharpening the business model around personal and private clients, wealthy individuals, entrepreneurs, \nfamily offices and commercial customers in international markets. Deeply committed to over 20 million clients across more \nthan 60 markets globally, Private Bank is a strong pillar of the overall Deutsche Bank Group. \nThe Personal Banking business is positioned as the market-leading franchise in Germany through its two major brands, \nDeutsche Bank and Postbank. Postbank offers German retail clients daily banking solutions with its “mobile-first” value \nproposition, while the Deutsche Bank brand focuses on investment advisory delivered via digital, remote and physical \nchannels.  \nIn 2024, the upgraded Postbank mobile app significantly accelerated the momentum of digital client engagement in \nGermany, contributing to the success of new deposit campaigns and to growing commercial activity on online platforms. \nContinued efforts to optimize the branch network were complemented by the successful evolution of the in-branch client \nexperience, highlighted by the opening of the new Postbank advisory branches and the deployment of digital coaches to \nguide clients in the digital transition. Internationally, Personal Banking focused on expanding the affluent client sector, \nwhile further innovating the customer value proposition through broader digital services and a leaner branch footprint, \nstrengthened by the launch of new landmark flagship branches. \nPrivate Bank decided to refocus its brand presence in the German mortgage and consumer finance business by \ndiscontinuing the DSL Bank brand over the course of 2025. This will allow to further reduce complexity and costs. DSL \nBank mortgages have so far been distributed primarily via partner platforms. The move is in line with the Private Bank’s \nambition to optimize its franchise portfolio towards capital-light businesses in order to improve profitability and capital \nefficiency of the segment. \nThe Wealth Management & Private Banking business maintained a well-diversified revenue mix across regions, focusing on \nultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) family entrepreneurs in the home market and internationally, as well as on private clients in \nEurope. Aspiring to be the Global Hausbank and partner of choice for family entrepreneurs, it is committed to creating \nlasting value and ensuring wealth preservation across generations. \nIn 2024, the business segment continued its expansive focus on attracting and serving ultra-high-net-worth clients, \nresulting in strong asset gathering in all regions and in a significant growth of net new asset inflows. In Germany, the \nbusiness segment established a dedicated ultra-high-net-worth coverage team in early 2024, while focusing on remote \nadvisory pilots and new Deutsche Bank Private Banking Centers to enhance the engagement with Private Banking clients. \nThe franchise accelerated the ‘One-Bank’ collaboration between Private and Corporate Bank, with successful client \nreferrals generating new asset inflows. In international markets, UHNW clients and Family Offices remained a priority, with \ntargeted product launches innovating the investment solution offering, especially in alternative investments. In Italy, Spain \nand Belgium, the business achieved increased penetration in core discretionary portfolio management solutions and \nfurther strengthened the ‘Bank for Entrepreneurs’ collaboration between Wealth Management and Business Banking. \nThe continued evolution of the Wealth Management & Private Banking proposition was recognized also within the industry, \nwith Private Bank winning 15 Euromoney ‘Best Private Bank’ 2024 awards, including in the categories ‘Best for \nEntrepreneurs’, ‘Best for UHNW’ and ‘Best for Transformation’, alongside regional and market-specific accolades. \nIn 2025, Private Bank will continue its transformation of the Personal Banking business, further building out digital and \nremote channels, while optimizing the physical footprint by closing traditional branches or converting them into flagship \nlocations. Growth will be driven by the upgrade of the offering with new digital account models and Discretionary Portfolio \nMandate (DPM) solutions, and by continued focus on deposit gathering. In Wealth Management & Private Banking scaling \nthe business in core markets will remain a key priority, supported by product innovation and further emphasis on DPM \nsolutions, building on the core sustainability offering.  \nIn sustainability, Private Bank advanced its announced strategy with successful product launches, award recognitions and \nin-house sustainability awareness initiatives, including trainings and business-wide information sessions. Private Bank \nenhanced its sustainability product portfolio, fostered strategic thematic collaborations, and focused on strengthening \nthe overall sustainability value proposition to support clients in their sustainable transition journeys. \n \n \n"}

DWS’ Passive segment, represented \nby the Xtrackers brand, sees sustained and profitable growth potential. Building on the franchise and European business, \nDWS has decided to invest in a U.S. growth plan including sustainable, thematic, and actively managed ETFs. Further, DWS \nsees a strong demand for mandates in Asia Pacific, and therefore plans to expand its customized mandates business. In \n2024, DWS successfully expanded the Xtrackers offering in the European UCITS segment, launched further Passive ETFs \nin the United States and established a portfolio management team in Hong Kong.

Deutsche Bank announced plans for € 2.1 billion in further capital distributions to \nshareholders in 2025. The bank has received supervisory authorization for further share repurchases of € 750 million in \n2025 and plans to propose 2024 dividends of € 1.3 billion, or € 0.68 per share, at its Annual General Meeting in May 2025, \nup 50% from € 0.45 per share for 2023. These measures would increase cumulative capital distributions to shareholders to \n€ 5.4 billion since 2022, in excess of the € 5 billion goal in the bank’s transformation program launched in 2019. The bank \nreaffirms its ambition to exceed its capital distribution goal of € 8 billion in respect of the financial years 2021-25, to be \npaid in 2022-26. \nProfit before tax was € 5.3 billion for the full year 2024, down 7% compared to 2023.

In 2023, \nprovision for credit losses was € 1.5 billion, or 31 basis points of average loans.  \nNoninterest expenses were € 23.0 billion in 2024, up 6% year on year.

Adjusted costs were € 20.4 billion, down 1% compared to the prior year. Higher compensation and \nbenefit expenses were largely offset by lower technology and professional services costs during the year. In 2025, the bank \nexpects to reduce noninterest expenses. Nonoperating costs in 2025 are expected to decrease as litigation as well as \nrestructuring and severance charges are expected to normalize. Adjusted costs are expected to remain essentially flat \ncompared to 2024, creating significant operating leverage. The bank is on track to achieve its target of € 2.5 billion euros \nin cost savings from its operational efficiency program, which offset additional investments to support further business \ngrowth and increased returns to shareholders beyond 2025.

The Investment Bank \nrecorded an increase of € 0.3 billion, primarily driven by higher net interest income partly offset by lower net gains on \nfinancial assets/liabilities mainly from a lower mark-to-market from derivatives in FIC Ex-Financing.

In \naddition, the decrease was also driven by lower management fees from unfavorable market conditions coupled with \nmargin compression in Asset Management.  \nNet gains (losses) on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income \n2024 \nNet gains (losses) on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income were € 48 million in 2024 and \n€ (0) million in 2023, mainly driven by a sale of bonds and securities from the strategic liquidity reserve. \n2023 \nNet gains (losses) on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income were € (0) million in 2023 and \n€ (216) million in 2022, with the result in 2022 driven by a sale of bonds and securities from the strategic liquidity reserve. \nNet gains (losses) on financial assets at amortized cost  \n2024 \nNet gains (losses) on financial assets at amortized cost were € (11) million in 2024 compared to € (96) million in 2023, driven \nby sales primarily related to the hold-to-collect portfolio. \n2023 \nNet gains (losses) on financial assets at amortized cost were € (96) million in 2023 compared to € (2) million in 2022, driven \nby realized losses on disposal of loans held in the hold to collect portfolio. \nNet income (loss) from equity method investments \n2024 \nNet income (loss) from equity method investments was € 12 million in 2024 compared to € (38) million in 2023, an increase \nof € 49 million, mainly related to an upward valuation of the underlying loan assets in Harvest Fund Management Company \nLimited. \n2023 \nNet income (loss) from equity method investments was € (38) million in 2023 compared to € 152 million in 2022, a decrease \nof € 190 million, mainly related to the downward valuation of the underlying loan assets in Huarong Rongde Asset \nManagement Company Limited as well as a gain on exit in 2022 which did not repeat in 2023. \nOther income (loss)  \n2024 \nOther income (loss) was € 619 million in 2024 compared to € 1.3 billion in 2023. The decrease was primarily related to the \nmarket movements in the hedge portfolio compared to gains in 2023. \n2023 \nOther income (loss) was € 1.3 billion in 2023 compared to € 789 million in 2022. The improvement was primarily related to \ngains in the hedging portfolios and the non-recurrence from gains on disposal of assets held for sale, including a gain from \nthe sale of the Deutsche Bank Financial Advisors business in Italy, as well as from workout activities related to Sal. \nOppenheim recognized in other revenues in 2022. This was partly offset by an unfavorable impact from valuation \nadjustments on fair value of guarantees in Asset Management, which had a corresponding offset in net gains (losses) on \nfinancial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit and loss. \n"}

Post-tax return on average shareholders’ equity was 9.1%, up from 4.8% in \n2023, and post-tax return on average tangible shareholders’ equity was 9.4%, up from 4.9%. The cost/income ratio was \n63%, down from 75% in 2023.  \nNet revenues were € 10.6 billion, 15% higher year on year reflecting market share gains in a growing Origination & Advisory \nfee pool, as well as strength in FIC. FIC ex. Financing revenues were € 5.4 billion, an increase of 8% year on year benefiting \nfrom strength in Credit Trading and increased client engagement more broadly. FIC Financing revenues grew 12% to \n€ 3.2 billion driven by both increased net interest income and higher commission and fees. Origination & Advisory revenues \nrose 61% year on year to € 2.0 billion primary due to increasing market share by around 50 basis points, combined with \nindustry fee pool growth during the year (source: Dealogic).  \nProvision for credit losses was € 549 million in the year, or 52 basis points of average loans, and significantly higher year \non year, reflecting increased Stage 3 provisions, primarily in CRE.  \nNoninterest expenses were € 6.7 billion in 2024, down 3% year on year, mainly reflecting the non-repeat of a goodwill \nimpairment in 2023. Adjusted costs were essentially flat at € 6.4 billion, with the full year impact of strategic investments \nin the second half of 2023 and adverse FX impact largely offset by a reduction in bank levies. \n2023 \nProfit before tax in 2023 was € 1.9 billion, down € 1.3 billion, or 42% compared to 2022. This reflects a decline in FIC \nrevenues compared to a very strong prior year, higher costs driven by strategic investments into the business, including \nthe acquisition of Numis, and increased provision for credit losses. Post-tax return on average shareholders’ equity was \n4.8%, down from 9.3% in the prior year. Post-tax return on average tangible shareholders’ equity was 4.9%, down from 9.6% \nin the prior year. The cost/income ratio in 2023 was 75%, compared to 64% in 2022. \nNet revenues were € 9.2 billion, a decrease of € 856 million, or 9% year on year. Revenues in FIC were € 7.9 billion, down \n€ 968 million, or 11% compared to 2022, which was the best FIC revenue performance in a decade. Revenues in Rates, \nEmerging Markets and Foreign Exchange were all significantly lower, reflecting reduced levels of market volatility and \nactivity. Credit Trading revenues were significantly higher due to the improved performance of Credit Flow following \ninvestments into the business. Financing revenues were robust and essentially flat to the prior year. \nOrigination & Advisory revenues were € 1.2 billion, an increase of € 249 million, or 25% year on year. This was primarily \ndriven by the non-recurrence of material leveraged lending markdowns in Leveraged Debt Capital Markets. Investment \nGrade debt revenues were lower, reflecting a decline in the industry fee pool (source: Dealogic). Advisory revenues were \nsignificantly lower due to reduced levels of announced deals coming into 2023. Equity Origination revenues were \nessentially flat to the prior year. \nResearch and Other revenues were € 21 million, compared to positive € 157 million in 2022. The year on year decrease was \nmaterially driven by a loss of € 47 million relating to the impact of debt valuation adjustments on certain derivative \nliabilities versus a gain of € 49 million in the prior year.  \nProvision for credit losses was € 431 million, or 42 basis points of average loans, an increase of € 112 million year on year \ndue to increased levels of stage 3 impairments, primarily in relation to Commercial Real Estate. \nNoninterest expenses in 2023 were € 6.8 billion, an increase of € 391 million or 6% year on year, primarily driven by an \nimpairment of Goodwill due to the Numis acquisition, as well as strategic investments made across the business and in line \nwith the previously communicated strategy. \n \n"}

As a result, starting 2024, demand \ndeposits of Private Banking in Germany were reclassified to Assets under Management, ensuring a consistent treatment within ‘Wealth Management & Private Banking’.

These impacts were partly offset by growth in deposit revenues during 2024. \nIn Wealth Management & Private Banking, net revenues grew by 2% year on year to € 4.1 billion in 2024. Higher investment \nproduct revenues, as well as slightly higher lending revenues, were partially offset by lower deposit revenues. \nProvision for credit losses was € 851 million, or 33 basis points of average loans, compared to 30 basis points of average \nloans in the prior year. The increase mainly reflected the continued elevated transitory effects from Postbank integration. \nOverall, the quality of the segment’s portfolios remains very solid. \nNoninterest expenses were € 7.3 billion in 2024, down 6% year-on-year including lower direct restructuring and severance \ncost and the nonrecurrence of provisions for individual litigation cases. The improvement in adjusted cost by 4% to \n7.0 billion in 2024 reflecting normalized investment spend and benefits from transformation initiatives including workforce \nreductions and the closure of 125 branches in 2024, as well as lower regulatory costs, partially offset by inflation impacts. \nAssets under management were € 633 billion at year end 2024, up € 55 billion in the year. The increase was mainly \nsupported by net inflows of € 29 billion, as well as € 20 billion positive market movements, and € 9 billion of positive \nforeign exchange movements. \n2023 \nPrivate Bank recorded a profit before tax of € 1.1 billion in 2023, compared to € 1.7 billion in the prior year, a decline of \n38%. The year-on-year development reflected significant nonoperating costs and revenue items. Nonoperating costs were \n€ 468 million in 2023, compared to a benefit of € 147 million in 2022. Furthermore, 2022 revenues included € 430 million \nin specific items which did not recur in 2023. These items impacted key ratios, with the cost/income ratio rising to 81%, \nfrom 75% in the prior year, while post-tax return on average shareholders’ equity declined to 4.8%, from 8.6% in 2022 and \npost-tax return on average tangible shareholders’ equity declined to 5.2%, from 9.2% in the prior year. Excluding \nnonoperating cost and specific revenue items, profit before tax would have been up 35% year on year. \nNet revenues were € 9.6 billion, up 5% year on year, or up 10% if adjusted for the non-recurrence of the aforementioned \n€ 430 million of specific items from last year. These included a gain of approximately € 310 million from the sale of the \nDeutsche Bank Financial Advisors business in Italy, and positive impacts from Sal. Oppenheim workout activities. Revenue \ngrowth was driven by higher net interest income from deposit products, partly offset by lower fee income and lower loan \nrevenues in a rising interest rate environment. The Private Bank attracted net inflows into assets under management of \n€ 23 billion in 2023, with net inflows in both investment products and deposits. Loan development reflected lower client \ndemand, mainly in mortgage loans in Germany and client deleveraging in APAC. \nIn Personal Banking, net revenues grew by 11% to € 5.6 billion as higher net interest income from deposit products more \nthan offset impacts from lower fee income due to changes in contractual and regulatory conditions. \nIn Wealth Management & Private Banking, net revenues were € 4.0 billion, down 4% year on year, or up 6% if adjusted for \nthe aforementioned impact of specific items, from non-recurring revenues of approximately € 50 million following the \nbusiness divestiture in Italy. Higher deposit revenues were offset by lower lending and investment revenues mainly in \nAPAC. \nAssets under management in the Private Bank were € 578 billion at year end, up € 35 billion in the year. The increase was \nmainly driven by net inflows of € 23 billion and by a € 19 billion beneficial impact from higher market levels partly offset \nby € 4 billion negative impact from foreign exchange rate movements. \nProvision for credit losses was € 783 million, or 30 basis points of average loans, compared to € 583 million, or 22 basis \npoints of average loans in the prior year. The increase mainly reflected a more difficult macroeconomic environment, higher \nimpacts of single name losses in the International Private Bank and effects from temporary operational backlog related to \nthe Postbank IT migration, while provision for credit losses in 2022 benefited from releases following sales of non-\nperforming loans. The development of the overall portfolio continued to reflect the high quality of the loan book, especially \nin the retail businesses, and ongoing tight risk discipline. \nNoninterest expenses were € 7.7 billion, up 13% year on year, driven predominantly by the aforementioned € 468 million \nin nonoperating costs, including restructuring and severance of € 346 million and litigation charges of € 123 million, \ncompared to releases of nonoperating costs of € 147 million in 2022. Adjusted costs, which exclude these items, were up \n4%, mainly reflecting investments in Group control functions, strategic initiatives, higher internal cost allocations, Postbank \nservice remediation and inflation impacts. These were partly mitigated by continued savings from transformation programs \nand reduced regulatory charges. \n"}

The effects from foreign exchange rate movements are \nembedded in the movement of the balance sheet line items discussed in this section. \nLiquidity \nTotal High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) as defined by the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/61 and amended \nby Regulation (EU) 2018/1620 increased to € 226 billion as of December 31, 2024 vs € 219 billion as at December 31, \n2023. The increase in HQLA is primarily on account of increased deposits and long-term debt issuance largely offset by \nremaining TLTRO repayment and asset growth across businesses. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio was 131% at the end fourth \nquarter of 2024, a surplus to regulatory requirements of € 53 billion as compared to 140% as at the end of fourth quarter \nof 2023, a surplus to regulatory requirements of € 62 billion. \nEquity  \nTotal equity as of December 31, 2024, was € 79.4 billion compared to € 74.8 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase \nof € 4.6 billion. This change was driven by a number of factors including the profit attributable to Deutsche Bank \nshareholders and additional equity components reported for the period of € 3.4 billion, the issuance of Additional Tier 1 \nequity instruments (AT1) treated as equity in accordance with IFRS of € 3.0 billion as well as unrealized net gains on \naccumulated other comprehensive income of € 530 million, net of tax, mainly on foreign currency translation of \n€ 928 million, net of tax, primarily resulting from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. This was partially \noffset by negative impacts from financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income of € 272 million, net of \ntax, and change in own credit risk of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss of € 126 million, net \nof tax. Further contributing factors include treasury shares distributed under share-based compensation plans of \n€ 444 million and remeasurement gains related to defined benefit plans of € 148 million, net of tax. These positive effects \nwere partially offset by net purchases of treasury shares of € 1.1 billion, cash dividends paid to Deutsche Bank shareholders \nof € 883 million, coupons paid on additional equity components of € 574 million as well as a change in noncontrolling \ninterests of negative € 156 million.  \nOn January 31, 2024, the Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG resolved a share repurchase program of up to \n€ 675 million which started on March 4, 2024 and was completed on July 11, 2024. In this period, Deutsche Bank AG \nrepurchased 46.4 million common shares. The repurchase of these shares has reduced total equity by € 675 million.  \nOn March 5, 2024, Deutsche Bank AG cancelled 45.5 million of its common shares, concluding its 2023 share buyback \nprogram. The cancellation reduced the nominal value of the shares by € 117 million. The cancelled shares had been held \nin common shares in treasury at their acquisition cost of € 450 million. The difference between the common shares at cost \nand their nominal value has reduced additional paid-in capital by € 333 million. The shares had already been deducted \nfrom the reported total equity on December 31, 2023. Therefore, the cancellation did not reduce total equity in 2024. \n \n \n"}

With respect to S&P, the credit ratings are endorsed by S&P’s office in Ireland \n(S&P Global Ratings Europe Limited) in accordance with Article 4(3) of the CRA Regulation. \nCredit Ratings Development \nThe rating agencies recognized the continued progress the bank has made over the course of 2024, specifically on \nrevenues despite a turning interest rate environment and pre-provision profitability. This was reflected in the positive \noutlook revision by Morningstar DBRS as well as rating and outlook affirmations by Moody’s, S&P and Fitch over the course \nof the year. The Postbank litigation case and related provisioning had no impact on their view of the bank’s \ncreditworthiness. \nOn June 11, 2024, Moody’s affirmed Deutsche Bank’s ratings as well as the stable outlook. The affirmation reflects the \nbank’s continued progress towards meeting its medium-term targets, in particular by being able to sustain improving \noperating profitability through revenue growth and cost efficiency. Moody’s also noted Deutsche Bank’s stabilized capital \nratios, high-quality deposit base as well as their assessment of the bank’s prudent and well-controlled risk appetite, which \nis likely to result in a sound and relatively stable asset quality through the cycle, in their view. \nOn June 21, 2024, Fitch affirmed Deutsche Bank’s ratings as well as the stable outlook. Fitch highlights that the ratings \nreflect Deutsche Bank’s restructured, fairly diversified business model, while the bank’s sound risk appetite, asset quality, \nfunding and liquidity support the ratings. The rating agency expects Deutsche Bank’s profitability to continue to improve \non the bank of consistent strategic execution in the next two years. \nOn June 26, 2024, Morningstar DBRS revised its outlook on Deutsche Bank’s ratings to positive from stable. The outlook \nchange reflects Deutsche Bank’s continued progress in implementing its strategic transformation program and meeting \nits medium-term profitability targets. In Morningstar DBRS’s view, Deutsche Bank has simplified and reoriented its business \nmix towards more predictable revenue sources, focusing on key growth areas. Morningstar DBRS considers Deutsche Bank \nto be in a good position to reach its 2025 revenue target and also takes into account the bank’s progress made on the cost \nside, which should help improve operating efficiency. Morningstar DBRS also highlights Deutsche Bank’s global franchise \nand leading position in Germany as well as high degree of business diversification. They note the bank’s sound funding \nprofile, strong liquidity cushions and solid capital levels with ample buffers over regulatory requirements and supported \nby sound internal capital generation. \nOn December 10, 2024, S&P affirmed Deutsche Bank’s ratings as well as the stable outlook. S&P highlights that the \naffirmation reflects Deutsche Bank’s continuously improving capitalization, supported by execution of the bank’s strategy \nfocused on a growing franchise as well as revenue momentum and cost discipline. S&P states that further progress towards \nits 2025 performance targets would bolster Deutsche Bank’s resilience. The rating agency also notes that the solid funding \nand liquidity profile supports the ratings. S&P expects Deutsche Bank’s asset quality to remain robust despite recent \neconomic and geopolitical developments. \nPotential Impacts of Ratings Downgrades \nDeutsche Bank calculates both the contractual and hypothetical potential impact of a one-notch and two-notch \ndowngrade by the rating agencies (Moody’s, S&P and Fitch) on its liquidity position and includes this impact in its daily \nliquidity stress test and Liquidity Coverage Ratio calculations.

U.S. tariffs threaten to \nfurther dampen momentum. The weakening of inflation is likely to allow the ECB to make\nfurther interest rate cuts. \nGDP \n0.8 \n0.7 \nInflation \n2.0 \n2.4 \nOf which: German \neconomy \nThe German economy is likely to expand slightly, driven solely by private and government \nconsumption spending. The cooling of the labor market could dampen the recovery of private\nconsumption. Structural competitive disadvantages and growing trade barriers are also likely \nto limit growth. With likely noticeably declining interest rates, construction could gain \nmomentum. \nGDP \n0.5 \n(0.2) \nInflation \n2.2 \n2.2 \nU.S. Economy \nUnderlying growth momentum is expected to remain solid. The labor market, and thus private \nconsumption, should hold up robustly. Tax cuts are likely to provide tailwinds. The expected \nincreases in import tariffs could ultimately be inflationary. The Fed is unlikely to cut key interest \nrates further, which should additionally limit growth. \nGDP \n2.6 \n2.8 \nInflation \n2.8 \n3.0 \nJapanese Economy \nFurther recovery of the Japanese economy is expected, driven by domestic demand.

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 71, "text": "39 \nDeutsche Bank  \nOutlook \nAnnual Report 2024 \nBanking industry \nThe global banking industry is expected to operate in a favorable environment in 2025. With stable global economic \ngrowth and a further moderate decline in interest rates, loan growth could pick up from low levels, while interest margins \ncould come under some pressure. Nevertheless, revenues overall could maintain positive momentum. The favorable \nsituation in capital markets expected to continue which should benefit investment banking and trading activities. Asset \nquality of banks is expected to remain largely robust and profitability should therefore remain high. Coupled with strong \ncapitalization, banks’ capital returns to shareholders both in form of dividends and share buybacks should therefore remain \nsubstantial.  \nAfter more than a decade of increasing regulation, political focus is now gradually shifting towards enhancing \ncompetitiveness, which could lead to initiatives to ease rules or to tax cuts in some jurisdictions. Strong earnings and higher \nstock market valuations could support sector consolidation to accelerate growth, especially domestically. Main risks for \nthe banking sector include elevated geopolitical risks, the potential for a correction of elevated stock market valuations \nand the risk of meaningful deterioration in credit quality if interest rates do not decline as much as expected or private-\nsector defaults require an increase of loan loss provisions. \nBanks in Europe are expected to face stronger headwinds than their U.S. peers from declining interest rates and margins. \nSubdued economic activity in major economies are expected to limit business volume growth. However, fee and \ncommission income could partially offset lower interest income as capital market activity may increase. In addition, \npolitical initiatives to promote the Capital Markets Union appear to be gaining more traction than in previous years and \ncould lead to significant progress in some areas such as securitization. Nominal net income is expected to remain close to \nits all-time high.  \nU.S. banks could substantially benefit from the new administration’s impetus for deregulation both of the real economy \nand also the financial system, although its extent is uncertain and any changes, if they materialize, may take time to feed \nthrough into results. A reduction in capital requirements compared to those envisaged so far in the implementation of final \nBasel III and less stringent capital market supervision, including of crypto assets, could support both banking sector and \nfinancial market growth. More immediately, a lower burden from unrealized losses on securities portfolios, either through \nbond sales or due to declining interest rates, would probably strengthen investor confidence in banks’ balance sheets \nfurther.  \nBanks in China may continue to suffer from the economic slowdown, and particularly the crisis in the real estate sector, as \nwell as from additional interest rate cuts, and the potential ramifications of a trade war with the U.S. However, mitigating \naction adopted by the government such as fiscal stimulus and more expansionary monetary policy should strengthen the \neconomy and also banks’ performance.

The bank also confirms its capital \nobjectives of a CET 1 capital ratio of around 13% and a payout ratio of 50% in respect of the financial year 2024 onwards. \nAll forward-looking projections below are based on January 31, 2025, foreign exchange rates. \nIn 2025, Deutsche Bank revenues are expected to be higher compared to the prior year. Deutsche Bank confirms its \nrevenue goal of around € 32 billion at Group level in 2025, which translates to around € 32.7 billion at January foreign \nexchange rates. This development is driven by the resilience and growth potential of the bank’s businesses and continued \nbusiness momentum. This growth is expected to result from both net interest income and noninterest income, reflecting \nthe bank's diversified business mix which allows around 75% of the expected revenues to come from more predictable \nrevenue streams. Corporate Bank revenues are expected to be higher in 2025 driven by higher net commissions and fee \nincome. Investment Bank revenues are expected to be higher in 2025 driven by benefits of the investments made in \nOrigination & Advisory which are expected to drive revenue improvement, while FIC is expected to see ongoing growth \nfrom the continued development of the FIC platform. Private Bank net revenues are expected to be slightly higher, \nbenefiting from growth in investment product revenues and slightly higher deposit revenues. In Asset Management, \nrevenues are expected to be higher driven by higher management fees from higher assets under management as well as \nhigher performance fees.  \nDeutsche Bank is managing the Group’s cost base towards its cost/income ratio target. Noninterest expenses in 2025 are \nexpected to be lower compared to 2024, primarily driven by significantly lower nonoperating costs as litigation and \nrestructuring and severance charges are expected to normalize. The bank remains highly focused on cost discipline and \ndelivery of the initiatives underway. Adjusted costs are expected to be essentially flat. Continued investments into business \ngrowth opportunities and technology, controls and regulatory remediation as well as persistent inflation are expected to \nbe largely offset by the bank’s benefits from structural efficiency measures as well as lower costs for bank levy and deposit \nprotection. These measures include the optimization of the Germany platform, the upgrade of technology architecture, \nthe front-to-back redesign of processes and measures to increase infrastructure efficiency. As a result, the bank now \ntargets a cost/income ratio of below 65% in 2025, marginally higher than the original target, to support further growth and \nbusiness momentum in and beyond 2025.  \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 73, "text": " \n \n41  \nDeutsche Bank  \nOutlook \nAnnual Report 2024 \nDeutsche Bank Group \nProvision for credit losses is expected to be on average around € 350 to € 400 million per quarter in 2025. The bank expects \na partial normalization of provision for credit losses in 2025 as transitory headwinds experienced throughout 2024 should \nsubside. These include cyclical events in the CRE sector, certain larger corporate credit events and temporary effects \nfollowing the Postbank integration. While economic and geopolitical risks continue to generate uncertainty, the bank \nremains confident in its expectations for credit provisions, supported by the high quality of the bank’s overall credit \nportfolios, including in Germany. Deutsche Bank remains committed to stringent underwriting standards and a tight risk \nmanagement framework. Further details on the calculation of expected credit losses are provided in the section \n“Combined Management Report: Risk Report”.  \nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET 1 ratio) by year end 2025 is expected to remain essentially flat compared to 2024. The \nbank’s pro-forma CET 1 ratio as of December 31, 2024, was 14.0% after the impacts from the adoption of CRR3, which \nbecame effective on January 1, 2025. This reflects an improvement of approximately 14 basis points compared to the \nreported CET 1 ratio under CRR 2. During the first quarter of 2025, CET 1 ratio is expected to be impacted by approximately \n20 basis points resulting from € 5 billion higher operational risk RWA. On a net basis, RWA are expected to be essentially \nflat from capital efficient business growth and despite the pro-forma CRR3 impact. Deutsche Bank aims to maintain a \nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of around 13%, i.e., to operate with a buffer of 200 basis points above the bank’s \nexpected maximum distributable amount (MDA) threshold. Leverage exposure is expected to be slightly higher while \nLeverage ratio should stay essentially flat at year-end 2025 compared to year-end 2024. The adoption of CRR3 increased \nthe bank’s pro-forma leverage ratio as of December 31, 2024, by approximately 6 bps to 4.7% due to lower leverage \nexposure for certain off-balance sheet items. \nDeutsche Bank plans to sustainably grow cash dividends and, over time, return excess capital to shareholders through \nshare buybacks over and above the requirements to support profitable growth and upcoming regulatory changes. Since \nthe financial year 2024 and subsequent years, the bank targets a payout ratio of 50% of net income attributable to \nDeutsche Bank shareholders, delivered through a combination of cash dividends and share buybacks. These distributions \nto shareholders are subject to shareholder authorization and German corporate law requirements, and in the case of share \nbuybacks additionally require prior regulatory approval. The bank has received supervisory approval for a share repurchase \nof € 750 million, which it aims materially to complete by the third quarter of 2025, having completed € 675 million in share \nrepurchases in 2024. Deutsche Bank plans to propose a dividend in respect of the 2024 financial year of € 0.68 per share, \nor approximately € 1.3 billion, up from € 0.45 per share for 2023, at the bank’s Annual General Meeting in May 2025. For \nthe financial year 2025, Deutsche Bank aims for a cash dividend of € 1.00 per share, subject to a 50% payout ratio limitation \nrelative to net income attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders. Deutsche Bank will continue to target a payout ratio of \n50% after 2025 through share buybacks and cash dividends, with cash dividends growing more moderately compared to \nincreases seen in recent years. The bank has set a capital distribution goal of € 8 billion in respect of the financial years \n2021-2025, to be paid in 2022-2026, and believes that it is positioned to exceed this objective based on the achievement \nof the bank’s financial targets. \nBy the nature of the bank’s business, Deutsche Bank is involved in litigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings and \ninvestigations in Germany and in a number of jurisdictions outside Germany, including in the United States. Such matters \nare subject to many uncertainties. While Deutsche Bank resolved a number of important litigation matters and made \nprogress on others, the bank expects the litigation and enforcement environment to remain challenging. For 2025, and \nwith a caveat that forecasting litigation charges is subject to many uncertainties, Deutsche Bank presently expects net \nlitigation charges to be significantly lower than the levels experienced in 2024. For more details, please refer to “Provisions” \nof this report. \nFor a discussion of the risks and opportunities for the outlook of Deutsche Bank please refer to the section “Risks and \nopportunities” of this report. \nAdjusted costs as well as Post-tax Return on Average Tangible Equity are non-GAAP financial measures.

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 76, "text": "44 \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisks and Opportunities \nAnnual Report 2024 \nRisks \nRisks and Opportunities \nThe following section focuses on future trends or events that may result in downside risk or upside potential from what \nDeutsche Bank has anticipated in its “Outlook”. \nThe Group’s aspirations are subject to various external and internal factors, some of which it cannot influence. Successful \nachievement of the bank’s 2025 strategic targets may be adversely impacted by reduced revenue generating capacities \nof some of the bank’s core businesses should downside risks crystallize. These risks include but are not limited to the \nchallenging macroeconomic environment in Europe, in particular Germany, and the potential for a re-emergence of \ninflationary pressures impacting the interest rate outlook. A number of geopolitical trends may exacerbate these risks, \nincluding potential for widespread imposition of trade tariffs by the new U.S. administration. Other risk factors include \ncyber events, the ongoing headwinds posed by regulatory reforms and the effects on the bank’s legal and regulatory \nproceedings. In 2024, focus remained on the impacts of higher interest rates on the bank’s portfolios, including \nCommercial Real Estate where market conditions have stabilized but a meaningful recovery is not expected until the \nsecond half of 2025. The bank’s German retail and corporate portfolios also faced increasing headwinds, but quality \nremains overall resilient. These trends could continue to drive high levels of uncertainty and impact the Group’s operations, \nstrategic plans and financial targets. \nOpportunities may arise if macroeconomic conditions, the inflation and interest rate environment improve beyond \ncurrently forecasted levels which suggest slightly stronger, albeit still weak, GDP growth in Europe but a moderate \nslowdown in the U.S. and China in 2025 compared to last year. A better macroeconomic environment could lead to higher \nrevenues and support the Group’s ability to meet its 2025 financial targets. In addition, the credit environment could \nimprove further on the back of stabilized European growth and solid growth still expected in the U.S.; as well as a continued \neasing of monetary policy by major central banks in 2025, which may result in a decrease in expected credit losses from \ncurrently forecasted levels. At the same time, potentially higher inflation and interest rate levels and market volatility could \nlead to increased revenues from trading flows and higher net interest income and lending margins. Through times of \nvolatility or uncertainty, Deutsche Bank could also benefit from helping clients navigate such financial markets. Focusing \non and investing in Deutsche Bank’s areas of core strengths and the implementation of the bank’s strategy may create \nfurther opportunities if implemented to a greater extent or under more favorable conditions than currently anticipated. \nRisks \nMacroeconomic and market conditions \nGlobal economic activity expanded at a robust pace in 2024, primarily driven by the U.S. economy which has outperformed \nexpectations. By contrast, economic performance in most of Europe remained challenging, especially in Germany. In 2025, \nthe U.S. economy is heading for slightly slower but solid growth driven by hopes of tax cuts and deregulation under the \nnew U.S. administration. Growth in the eurozone area is set to pick up moderately, but Germany is expected to lag behind \nwith selected sectors such as automotives seeing weak demand growth and elevated structural risks over the medium-\nterm. Political uncertainty in the eurozone is elevated with recent German elections held in February with coalition talks in \nprogress, potentially leading to disappointment on structural reforms. While the new minority government in France has \nyet to develop a credible fiscal consolidation strategy to stabilize the elevated public debt ratio against strong political \nresistance. In addition, European economies face external downside risks from potential U.S. trade tariffs and from China \nwhere domestic activity lacks momentum and the highly indebted real estate sector is yet to show signs of a turnaround. \nWith headline and core inflation approaching central bank targets, the ECB and Fed lowered their key policy rates by 100 \nbps each in the second half of 2024. However, inflationary pressure remains elevated especially in the U.S. against the \nbackdrop of a firm labor market. Moreover, if the new U.S. administration cuts taxes, impose higher tariffs and lowers \nmigration, this would likely increase the risk of inflation and higher interest rates. Additionally, global supply chain \npressures from ongoing geopolitical tensions could also fuel inflation. The outlook for interest rates has become more \nuncertain and markets price fewer rate cuts in the U.S. compared to a few months ago. Should inflation exceed current \nexpectations, the Fed and other central banks could be forced to resume policy tightening and increase the risk of a cyclical \neconomic recession including higher unemployment and defaults.  \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 77, "text": " \n \n45  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisks and Opportunities \nAnnual Report 2024 \nRisks \nInflation and increase of interest rate could dampen consumer spending and private client investments. Therefore, there \nmay be temporary reduction in new business for consumer finance and/or private mortgages lending. Additionally \nincreasing inflation could lead to payment difficulties for Private Clients due to reduced inflation-adjusted income and \ncould lead to increasing delinquent exposure with respective impact on provisions for credit losses. \nHigher interest rates may lead to refinancing risks and potential downgrades for Corporates, SME, Commercial clients and \nPrivate clients. In addition, inflation, interest rates and market volatility could lead to an asset price reduction of collaterals \nwith risks related recovery values in case of liquidation and therefore respective higher impacts on provisions for credit \nlosses. Asset price reduction of collaterals could also lead to a potentially higher refinancing risk. \nA persistently higher than expected interest rate environment would also increase the risk of corrections in highly valued \npockets of risk asset markets, e.g. the technology segment of U.S. equity markets. A prolonged, more severe bout of \nvolatility could adversely impact global monetary and credit conditions and Deutsche Bank’s business environment.  \nCRE markets remain under stress from the impact of higher interest rates, borrowing costs and tight lending conditions \nleading to ongoing pressure on collateral values, particularly in the office sector, and may result in higher than expected \nprovisions for credit losses. Recent evidence suggests that CRE property prices and broader market conditions are \nstabilizing. The turn in the monetary cycle may help to support market sentiment and ease refinancing conditions from the \nsecond half of 2025 although refinancing risk remains elevated in the near term. The adjustment process in the office \nsector is expected to persist for the next several years.  \nPrivate capital markets, which include certain activities from non-bank financial institutions and private credit more \nbroadly, may also be negatively impacted by higher than expected interest rates and weaker investor sentiment. The non-\nbank financial institutions sector is extremely broad with diverse risk profiles and vulnerabilities. A failure of one or multiple \nlarger non-bank financial institutions has the potential to drive direct losses for banks including Deutsche Bank and other \ncreditors/capital providers. Broader market instability with rising rates, risk aversion, market illiquidity and economic \nslowdown all increase the likelihood of failures occurring as returns drop and investors reallocate capital. Internal risk \nmanagement approaches are commensurate to the risk profile of underlying counterparty and concentration risk \nexposures and although Deutsche Bank has not experienced any noteworthy losses in the past, the bank may do so in the \nfuture. \nDeutsche Bank’s crypto related activities and direct risk exposures are extremely limited and the risk of broader contagion \nto financial markets is still considered to be limited. Despite the risks currently posed by crypto assets, the bank is cognizant \nof the innovation that is occurring in this space. \nOverall, either in isolation or in combination with other risk factors such as the potential escalation of geopolitical risks (see \nbelow), the aforementioned risks could lead to a deterioration in Deutsche Bank’s portfolio quality and higher than \nexpected credit losses as well as increased capital and liquidity demands as clients draw down on funding lines. Higher \nvolatility in financial markets could lead to increased margin calls, higher market risk RWA and elevated valuation reserves. \nNegative impacts on investor appetite may also impact the Group’s ability to distribute and de-risk capital market \ncommitments, which could potentially result in losses as well as making pricing and hedging more challenging and costly. \nHigher volatility in capital markets amidst the challenging macro environment could also lead to increased inherent risks \nin several non-financial risks including transaction processing, internal and external fraud. It also increases the risk of \nidiosyncratic counterparty events both directly and indirectly, for example shortfalls under Lombard or securities financing \ntransactions. \nA substantial proportion of the assets and liabilities on the Group’s balance sheet comprise of financial instruments that \nare carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. As a result of such changes, the \nGroup has incurred losses in the past, and may incur further losses in the future. The Group is exposed to risks related to \nmovements from foreign exchange rates, most notably related to the USD and GBP. The bank also accounts for a \nsubstantial portion of assets and liabilities at amortized costs. The fair value of these assets may be lower than its carrying \nvalue and could result in realized losses if the asset is sold prior to maturity. \nThe Group is exposed to pension risks which can materially impact the measurement of Deutsche Bank’s pension \nobligations, including interest rate, inflation and longevity risks that can materially impact its earnings.  \nIf multiple downside risks simultaneously materialize and/or occur in combination with a more pronounced economic \nslowdown, the negative impact on Deutsche Bank’s business environment could be more severe than currently expected \nand impact the bank’s ability to meet its 2025 financial targets. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 78, "text": " \n \n46  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisks and Opportunities \nAnnual Report 2024 \nRisks \nGeopolitics  \nA number of political and geopolitical risks and events could negatively affect Deutsche Bank’s business environment, \nincluding weaker economic activity, financial market corrections, compliance risks or a lower interest rate environment \nwhich could reduce the bank’s ability to achieve its 2025 financial targets. \nThere is particular focus on the future policies of the new U.S. administration around international trade and energy. There \nis a risk that some of these policies could result in higher inflation and interest rates and uncertainty around the outlook \nfor key geopolitical risks. For instance, the U.S. administration has considered additional tariffs on imported goods \nespecially those from key trading partners such as Canada, Mexico and China, which if implemented could negatively \nimpact growth and fuel inflation in the U.S. This in turn, could lead to increased provisions for credit losses. Besides, the \nU.S. administration has proposed to reduce funding and subsidies for clean energy initiatives which may impact companies \nwho are active in renewables.  \nThe ongoing war in Ukraine and potential risk that U.S. military support may potentially be reduced, continue to increase \nEuropean concern and may lead to heightened uncertainty and business disruption. . Meanwhile, the risk of a Middle East \nconflict remains elevated, despite the fragile temporary ceasefire agreed between Israel and Hamas, and the fact that Iran \nand its terrorist proxies have been weakened by Israel’s military strikes and the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria. While \nthe market reaction remains contained thus far, a further escalation could lead to negative impacts including higher oil \nprices, volatility in the markets and supply chain disruption which may in turn impact Deutsche Bank’s risk profile.  \nAmidst the ongoing war in Ukraine, potential further sanctions, as well as countermeasures by the Russian government, \ncontinue to increase complexity of operations and create conflict of law situations. Against the challenging sanctions \nbackdrop, banks have been implicated in economic disputes of and with counterparties which could result in costs or \nlosses which would not occur in the normal course of business. While an immediate adverse impact to assets in Russia was \naverted, the recent Russian court orders against various western banks pose downside risk. \nAlso, tensions between the U.S. and China remain elevated across a wide range of areas, including trade and technology-\nrelated issues, Hong Kong, Taiwan, human rights, tariffs and cybersecurity. Amidst the inauguration of Taiwan’s newly \nelected president last year, China conducted large-scale military exercises around Taiwan, thereby continuing to apply \npressure on the island while also aggressively staking out its territorial claims in the South China Sea. While the bank does \nnot consider a China/Taiwan military conflict as its base case in the near-term, potential downside impacts from an \nescalation are significant and could substantially and adversely affect Deutsche Bank’s planned results of operations and \nfinancial targets. Geopolitical tensions could drive further economic polarization and fragmentation of global trade with \nthe possible emergence of distinct China vs. US-led supporters. Overall, potential downside impacts could adversely affect \nDeutsche Bank’s planned results of operations and financial targets. \nIn many democratic countries, domestic political challenges have arisen from growing political polarization, rising social \ndiscontent and higher inflation. These challenges including recent German elections may impede political decision-making \nprocesses, forestall necessary structural reforms and lead to negative economic outcomes which could directly or \nindirectly impact the bank’s risk profile and financial results. \nStrategy  \nDeutsche Bank’s Global Hausbank strategy includes financial targets and objectives for the Group until the end of 2025. \nWhile the Group continuously plans and adapts to changing situations, the bank runs the risk that a significant \ndeterioration in the global macroeconomic environment, an adverse change in market confidence in the banking sector \nand/or client behavior, as well as higher competition, inflation or unforeseen costs could lead to the bank missing its 2025 \nfinancial targets and capital objectives. As such, Deutsche Bank may incur unexpected losses including impairments and \nprovisions, experience lower than planned profitability or an erosion of the bank’s capital or liquidity base and broader \nfinancial condition, leading to a material adverse effect on Deutsche Bank’s results of operations and share price. This also \nincludes the risk that Deutsche Bank will not be able to make desired cash distributions and share buybacks, subject to \nregulatory approval, shareholder authorization and meeting German corporate law requirements. Where targets reflect \ncommitments to regulators, missing them may also trigger action from such regulators or rating agencies. In these \nsituations, the Group would need to take actions to ensure it meets its minimum capital or liquidity objectives.

The ability to deploy capital and fund investments \nis an important success factor. The Group continuously monitors and responds to competitive developments to protect its \nmarket position and realize growth opportunities. Competitors in that context include large, international banks, smaller \ndomestic banks as well as emerging and non-banking competitors. If significant competitors were to merge or be acquired, \nthis could have impact on Deutsche Bank’s business model and opportunities to grow non-organically in the future. \nIn 2024, employee turnover rates exceeded prior year’s level, mainly driven by the regions Asia Pacific, Middle East & Africa \nand by the Americas. In general, the development of turnover rates could impact the bank’s operations and cost structures. \nInflation and growing full-time equivalent employee costs are an additional risk over and above employee turnover rates. \nDeutsche Bank has the objective to preserve a CET 1 ratio of no less than 200 basis points above the bank’s Maximum \nDistributable Amount (MDA) threshold with some variability possible in 2025. The Group’s capital ratio development \nreflects among other things: the operating performance of the bank’s operating businesses; the extent of its restructuring \ncosts and the delivery of associated benefits from change initiatives including for example front-to-back optimization \nprograms; cost related to potential litigation and regulatory enforcement actions; growth in the balance sheet usage of \nthe core businesses; changes in the bank’s tax and pensions accounts; impacts on other comprehensive income; and \nchanges in regulation and regulatory technical standards. \nThe Group enters into contracts and letters of intent in connection with its ongoing evolution as well as in the ordinary \ncourse of business. When these are preliminary in nature or conditional, the Group is exposed to the risk that they do not \nresult in execution of the final agreement or consummation of the proposed arrangement, putting associated benefits with \nsuch agreements at risk. \nThe financial results of the bank could be adversely impacted if anticipated benefits from mergers and acquisitions, joint \nventures, strategic partnerships, planned cost savings and other investments do not materialize. At the same time, any \nintegration process will require significant time and resources, and the bank may not be able to manage the process \nsuccessfully. \nAll of the above could have a material impact on the Group’s CET 1 ratio as well as other target ratios. It is therefore \npossible that the bank will fall below e.g., the CET 1 ratio objective of no less than 200 basis points above the bank’s MDA \nthreshold, not meet the cost/income ratio target, or the Post-tax Return on Average Tangible Equity target, as highlighted \nin the section “Strategy” in this report. \nLiquidity and funding  \nDeutsche Bank maintained investment grade ratings with all leading credit rating agencies through the year 2024. \nDuring 2024, inflationary pressures eased globally, leading many central banks to commence reducing interest rates. The \npace of that reduction, however, varies depending upon other economic factors affecting different jurisdictions which \ncould in turn affect liquidity supplies and funding costs across the different jurisdictions in which the bank operates. \nAt the same time, a further downturn in the macro-economic environment, particularly in Germany and other European \njurisdictions could lead to a decline in deposit levels and loan growth. This effect could lead to customers moving away \nfrom overnight to term deposits in search of better rates in the current environment which could be further exacerbated \nby competitive pricing pressures from other deposit-taking institutions. \nAdditional liquidity risks, due to negative developments in the wider financial sector, may also occur from withdrawal of \ndeposits not insured by deposit guarantee schemes or result in deposits moving into other investment products. In times \nof economic uncertainty or market stress, digital banking allows depositors to swiftly move funds digitally to other market \nparticipants, leading to a faster and larger scale of deposit outflows. This risk may be exacerbated by the rollout of the \nInstant Payments Regulation which could lead to accelerated outflows outside of normal business hours in addition to \nincreased needs for intraday liquidity. In addition, higher interest rates could foster price competition among banks for \nretail deposits increasing Deutsche Bank’s funding costs, as well as putting further pressure on the volume of Deutsche \nBank’s retail deposits, which are one of the main funding sources for the bank. \nIn addition, these perceptions could affect the prices at which Deutsche Bank could access the capital markets to obtain \nthe necessary funding to support its business activities. Another impact could be the expectation among some market \nparticipants that callable securities, typically Tier 2 and Additional Tier 1, but also senior debt, will be called at the first \navailable call date. In the event the bank decides not to exercise the call, there may be a negative impact on Deutsche \nBank’s funding curve due to a combination of investor dissatisfaction and potential signaling of financial difficulties. The \nmagnitude of the impact on funding spreads is dependent on a series of factors including, amongst others, the reset spread \nand coupon of the security as compared to current market conditions. Such events could result in an inability to refinance \nassets on balance sheet, business activities in their respective currencies, or maintain appropriate levels of capital. As a \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 80, "text": " \n \n48  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisks and Opportunities \nAnnual Report 2024 \nRisks \nresult, the bank may be forced to liquidate assets it holds at depressed prices or on unfavorable terms, and to curtail \nbusinesses, such as lending activities. This could have an adverse effect on Deutsche Bank’s business, financial condition \nand results of operations. \nSimilarly, liquidity risk could arise from lower value and marketability of Deutsche Bank’s High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA). \nMoreover, Liquidity risk could affect the amount of proceeds available for covering cash outflows during a stress event. \nAdditional haircuts may be incurred on top of already impaired asset values. Moreover, securities might lose their eligibility \nas collateral necessary for accessing Central Bank facilities, as well as their value in the repo/wholesale funding market. At \nthe same time, the Group’s liquidity position may also be impaired in situations where its counterparty on e.g., a derivative \ncontract is not current on an obligation to post collateral, in which case the bank has to cover for the shortfall through \nother means. The impact of such situations could be further pronounced to the extent the bank’s exposures to particular \ncounterparties or markets are significant. \nWhile the liquidity environment of the bank has been relatively stable, continued uncertainties in the geopolitical and \neconomic environment could have an adverse impact on Deutsche Bank’s credit spread levels, liquidity metrics or the \nbank’s rating in the future. As of December 31, 2024, the bank demonstrated strong liquidity and funding metrics which \nwere well above the regulatory requirements and internal risk appetite, providing a strong basis to manage, if required, \nthrough future periods of market volatility or stress. \nPrivate Bank backlogs  \nFollowing the completion of the data migration of Postbank in July 2023, Deutsche Bank experienced operational issues \nand client backlog which led to delays in processing inquiries and increased credit costs. Residual backlogs have now been \nresolved and the bank made further efforts to successfully improve its service processes in 2024. New incoming client \nrequests are now generally processed within defined service levels.  \nRegulatory supervisory reforms, assessments and proceedings  \nThe regulatory reforms enacted and proposed in response to weaknesses identified during the last financial crisis together \nwith increased regulatory scrutiny and discretion will impose material costs on the bank, create significant uncertainty and \nmay adversely affect the Group’s business plans as well as its ability to execute the bank’s strategic plans in the medium-\nterm. Those changes that require the bank to maintain increased capital may significantly affect the bank’s business model, \nfinancial condition, and results of operation as well as the competitive environment more generally. This could occur more \ngenerally with regards to the UK. With the UK being outside the European Union, it can be more agile on the future direction \nof its supervisory and regulatory framework. Given Deutsche Bank’ set-up in the UK as a branch, we will not be able to \nbenefit in general from improvements made to the UK framework. \nSupervisors can also impose capital surcharges or regulatory adjustments, for example, as a result of the regular \nSupervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) performed by the ECB on an annual basis. Such adjustments may, for \nexample, reflect additional risks posed by deficiencies in the Group’s control environment, concerning the treatment of \nspecific portfolios, products or transactions. Following the 2024 SREP, Deutsche Bank has been informed by the ECB of \nits decision regarding prudential capital requirements to be maintained from January 1, 2025, onwards, that Deutsche \nBank’s Pillar 2 Requirement amounts to 2.90%, an increase of twenty-five basis points compared to the bank’s Pillar 2 \nRequirement applicable for 2024. ECB’s SREP decision also includes a Pillar 2 Requirement for the leverage ratio of 10 \nbasis points, unchanged versus prior year SREP and effective from January 1, 2025, onwards. Further, the decision includes \nconclusions the ECB draws from regulatory stress tests conducted by the EBA or the ECB. The results of the EBA EU wide \nstress test launched on January 20, 2025, will be published at the beginning of August. The ECB evaluates each bank’s \nperformance from a qualitative angle to inform the decision on the level of Pillar 2 Requirement and a quantitative \noutcome which is one aspect when assessing the level of Pillar 2 Guidance. The ECB has already used these powers in its \nSREP decisions in the past and it may continue to do so to address findings from onsite inspections. In extreme cases, the \nECB can even suspend certain activities or permission to operate within their jurisdictions and impose monetary fines for \nfailures to comply with rules applicable to the guidelines. \nRegulators across the world can also impose capital surcharges to address macroeconomic risks, through the use of \nmacroprudential tools. These include CET1 buffer increases that could apply group-wide or only for local activities at \nnational level or for specific types of exposures (e.g., mortgages). The use of these tools is governed by the applicable \nmacroprudential framework in the EU or any other relevant jurisdiction and are typically decided by national \nmacroprudential authorities, such as BaFin, often on the basis of Central Bank analysis for macroeconomic risks. \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 81, "text": " \n \n49  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisks and Opportunities \nAnnual Report 2024 \nRisks \nSeveral future changes to macroprudential tools are expected to impact Deutsche Bank’s business. The European \nCommission had previously announced a review of the EU macroprudential regime for 2022-2023. These reviews did not \ntake place within the envisaged timeline. The European Commission will continue looking at these issues in 2025, and there \nis always a possibility for a legislative proposal. Such reforms could result in an increase of the bank’s level of capital \nrequirements, including capital buffers, additional capital requirements for securitizations, an increase in risk-weighted \nassets or other regulatory requirements related to the banks’ dealings with various types of counterparties, including Non-\nBank Financial Intermediaries (NBFI). \nIn July 2024, the EU prudential rules (Capital Requirements Regulation and Directive – CRR3 and CRD 6) was published in \nthe EU Official Journal. The reform implements the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) Final Basel III reforms. \nThese reforms change how EU banks will calculate their risk weighted assets. The biggest part of the reforms will apply as \nof January 2025, with the exception of the rules on Market Risk (implementing the Fundamental Review of the Trading \nBook – FRTB), which has been delayed by the European Commission, via a Delegated Act, to January 2026. The output \nfloor, which limits the internal-model RWA to ultimately 72.5% of the Standardized Approach RWA, will apply fully in \nJanuary 2030. Final Basel III will increase the bank’s RWA and associated capital requirements. The reform is also being \nimplemented, with different timelines, in all major jurisdictions. At the start of 2024, the EBA consulted on amendments \nto its RTS (Regulatory Technical Standard) on prudent valuation. This standard sets out the requirements that institutions \noperating in the EU should apply for the valuation of their fair-valued assets and liabilities for prudential purposes. The \nEBA is working through the comments received, depending on their final view, this may lead to increase in our CET1 \nrequirements. The EBA also consulted on change to their RTS on off-balance sheet items. This approach also looking into \nthe treatment of chargeback payments. Similar to the prudent valuation RTS, the EBA is working through the comments, \nand the bank expect a final RTS to be published in third quarter 2025. This will provide further steer on the prudential \ntreatment of chargeback risk. \nIn April 2023, the European Commission issued a legislative proposal for reform of the EU crisis management and deposit \ninsurance framework, with amendments to all relevant Directives and Regulations, including the Bank Recovery and \nResolution Directive, the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation and the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive. The \npurpose of the legislative proposal is, among other things, to further harmonize and regulate the crisis management and \nresolution of small- and medium-sized EU banks, which is currently subject to some degree of national discretion. In its \nlegislative proposal the Commission includes several changes that could impact Deutsche Bank and its clients, including \na change in the insolvency hierarchy of claims of all depositors, including those uninsured by deposit guarantee schemes. \nAlso, the proposals provide for an expanded possibility by authorities to use the funds of national deposit guarantee \nscheme to contribute to the resolution of a bank, and thus giving also access to the Single Resolution Fund. This European \nCommission legislative proposal has been following the regular EU co-legislative process, with the involvement of the EU \n27 Member States and the European Parliament. The finalization of the revised directives and regulation may happen in \n2025, or in a later year, depending on the ability of the co-legislators to reach a compromise, and could differ significantly \nfrom the original Commission proposal. \nOn December 12, 2024, a provisional agreement between the co-legislators was reached on the revised EU Benchmarks \nRegulation which will reduce the scope of application of the Regulation significantly by focusing only on the supervision \nof critical and significant benchmarks as well as those which are Paris-aligned or Climate Transition benchmarks and some \ncommodity benchmarks. Due to the inclusion of an exemption for certain third-country foreign exchange (spot FX) \nbenchmarks, the revised EU Benchmark Regulations will contribute to a reduction in regulatory burden on EU users of \nbenchmarks.  \nThe Retail Investment Strategy, a European Commission proposal from May 24, 2023, containing a series of measures and \namendments to the current legislative framework to strengthen investor participation and consumer trust remains in the \nlegislative process with the Parliament and Council having finalized their respective positions. Trilogues are expected to \nstart in early 2025.  \nThe revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation (MiFID II/R) entered into force on March 28, 2024. \nFurther technical work by ESMA and the European Commission on transparency requirements and the consolidated tape \nhave started in 2024 and will continue through 2025. \nIn June 2023, the European Commission published two legislative packages, one linked to the introduction of a digital \neuro, the other on financial data access and payments. The European Parliament and EU Member States are now to discuss \nboth packages. Both texts are still under discussion at European Parliament and member state levels.  \nIn 2024, the regulatory environment for ESG and Sustainable finance further evolved. At EU level, the regulation for ESG \nrating providers as well as the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) were finalized. The CSDDD \nrequires e.g. the establishment of a transition plan and includes due diligence obligations for corporates and banks to avoid \nand mitigate human rights and environmental risks in their value chains. The application of the Deforestation regulation \nwhich supports deforestation-free products and supply chains would have been applicable end of 2024 but was delayed \n"}

The prevention of greenwashing continues to be a relevant topic. In June, the three European Supervisory \nAuthorities comprising of the EBA, the ESMA, and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority published \ntheir final reports on greenwashing in the financial sector. The UK announced in November to resume work on Sustainable \nFinance regulation, including proposals for a Green Taxonomy and a ESG rating regulation. \nAlso, Transition Finance remains a priority for regulators. ESMA and EBA highlighted the need for further work on the topic. \nThe UK’s Transition Finance Market Review published a final report, providing a framework for scaling up the market for \ntransition finance and a Transition Finance Council was launched by the UK government. In January 2024, the ECB \nextended its climate strategy and announced a climate and nature plan to work on how nature loss and degradation pose \nrisks to the economy. \nIn addition, Deutsche Bank may be impacted by future decisions made by the Court of Justice of the EU in regard to the \nterms and conditions related to irrevocable payment commitments to the SRF. If a ruling by the court is deemed to have a \nnegative impact on the current accounting treatment of such irrevocable payment commitments, this could result in an \naccounting loss and have a material adverse effect on the bank’s results of operations. Deutsche Bank updates the BaFin \non the status of the discussions and our internal work to continue clearing for our clients. \nFor Indian CCPs, the BaFin published a statement in February 2023, allowing German credit institutions, including \nDeutsche Bank, the possibility to remain members of the six India CCPs until October 31, 2024. The BaFin, as well as the \nFrench AMF and ACPR granted indefinite extension of this deadline, allowing time for European banks together with the \nrelevant European and Indian authorities to continue work on finding a solution. This allows European banks, including \nDeutsche Bank, to make any changes needed so that the clients can continue to be served even after the deadline. \nSupervisors can also impose other capital surcharges, such as the increase of macroprudential capital buffers including \nthe Countercyclical Capital Buffer and the Systemic Risk Buffer.  \nIn summary, both the regulatory and legislative environment are expected to be dynamic and can impact Deutsche Bank’s \nrevenue and costs (e.g., the cost to ensure ongoing and future compliance). Additionally, the prospect of regulatory \nconditions easing in certain non-European regions could present a competitive disadvantage to the Group. \nLegal and regulatory enforcement proceedings and tax examinations  \nDeutsche Bank is subject to a number of legal and regulatory enforcement proceedings and tax examinations. The \noutcome of these proceedings is difficult to predict and may substantially and adversely affect the bank’s planned results \nof operations, financial condition and reputation. If these matters are resolved on terms that are more adverse to the bank \nthan expected, in terms of their costs or necessary changes to Deutsche Bank’s businesses or operations, or if related \nnegative perceptions concerning the bank’s business and prospects and related business impacts increase, Deutsche Bank \nmay not be able to achieve its strategic objectives or may be required to change these objectives. \nMore generally, the bank operates in a highly and increasingly regulated and litigious environment, potentially exposing \nthe bank to liability and other costs, the amounts of which may be substantial and difficult to estimate, as well as to legal \nand regulatory sanctions and reputational harm. The bank continues to maintain a regular dialogue with its supervisory \nauthorities who expect the bank to deliver control improvements at a faster pace and in a higher quality manner. Deutsche \nBank understands this criticism and is committed to meeting these expectations. \nThe latest geopolitical development in the U.S. and elsewhere may increase the complexity and costs to comply with \nchanging laws and rules, potential conflicts of laws as multiple regulatory regimes may come into sharper difference in \nvarious jurisdictions, and legal risks as novel applications of pre-existing laws are made, such as, the application of \ntraditional antitrust law in the context of multi-party ESG initiatives. Should any of the legal proceedings be resolved \nagainst the bank, or any investigations result in a finding that the bank failed to comply with applicable law, the bank could \nbe exposed to material damages, fines, limitations on business, remedial undertakings, criminal prosecution, or other \nmaterial adverse effects on Deutsche Bank’s financial condition, as well as risk to its reputation and potential loss of \nbusiness because of extensive media attention. Guilty pleas by or convictions of the bank or its affiliates in criminal \nproceedings, or regulatory or enforcement orders, settlements, or agreements to which the bank or its affiliates become \nsubject, may have consequences that have adverse effects on certain of its businesses. \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 83, "text": " \n \n51  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisks and Opportunities \nAnnual Report 2024 \nRisks \nCompliance and Anti-Financial Crime  \nCombatting financial crime and complying with applicable laws and regulations is vital to ensuring the stability of banks, \nsuch as Deutsche Bank, and the integrity of the international financial system.  \nA robust and effective internal control environment and adequate infrastructure (comprising people, policies and \nprocedures, controls testing, IT systems and data) are necessary to ensure that the bank conducts its business and \nperforms its processes in general in compliance with the laws, regulations, and associated supervisory expectations.  \nThe bank’s compliance controls and surveillance processes, as well as other internal control processes that are aimed at \nensuring the proper conduct of its businesses and services as well at preventing market abuse, insider dealing, and conduct \nbreaches, are subject to regulatory reviews and/or inquiries in certain jurisdictions. \nFurthermore, the bank’s anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your client (KYC) processes and controls aimed at \npreventing misuse of the bank’s products and services to commit financial crime, continue to be the subject of regulatory \nreviews, investigations, and enforcement actions in several jurisdictions. The bank continually enhances the effectiveness \nof its internal control environment and improve its infrastructure to revised regulatory requirements and to close gaps \nidentified by the bank and/or by regulators and monitors. \nIn September 2018, BaFin ordered Deutsche Bank to implement internal safeguards and comply with general due diligence \nobligations to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. In February 2019, BaFin extended the order with regards \nto the review of its group-wide risk management processes in correspondent banking and adjust them as necessary. In \nApril 2021, BaFin further expanded its order, requiring additional internal safeguards and sustainable compliance with due \ndiligence obligations, including those for correspondent relationships. The April 2021 order was subsequently extended \nto include enhancements to the Bank’s transaction monitoring systems. \nIn 2023, the BaFin issued an additional order instructing Deutsche Bank to implement specific improvements to data \nprocessing systems for transaction monitoring and warned of potential financial penalties in case of non-fulfillment. \nTo monitor the implementation of the ordered measures, BaFin appointed a Special Representative in 2018, whose \nmandate was prolonged following each order extension to ensure continued monitoring and progress assessment. This \nmandate concluded on October 30, 2024. The bank continues to fully cooperate with the BaFin and remains committed \nto investing the necessary resources to implement the remaining measures within the deadlines. \nIn July 2023, the bank entered into a Consent Order and Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve resolving previously \ndisclosed regulatory discussions concerning adherence to prior orders and settlements related to sanctions and \nembargoes and AML compliance, a prior correspondent banking relationship and remedial agreements and obligations \nrelated to risk management issues. Both the Consent Order and Written Agreement require the bank to comply with and \neffectuate certain remedial undertakings. To the extent the Bank does not comply with such undertakings, it may face \nadditional regulatory action, including further civil monetary penalties and business restrictions.  \nThe war in Ukraine continues to lead to a high increase of sanctions by G7 countries targeting Russian individuals, entities, \ngoods, industry sectors as well as enablers in third countries. Specifically, 2023 and 2024 were characterized by sanctions \nresponding to Russia’s measures avoiding the effect of sanctions, such as EU or U.S. secondary sanctions which allow \nmeasures to be taken against Foreign Financial Institutions if they conduct certain transactions with Russian targeted \nsectors, designated persons or products. In addition, the EU requires EU entities to mandate their non-EU subsidiaries to \nnot take any action undermining the effect of the EU sanctions against Russia. Together with the expansive new EU \nreporting requirements these measures increase operational burden and regulatory risk for banks with clients that have \nbusiness operations in or with entities in Russia. Similarly, the EU has enhanced sanctions against Belarus. The U.S. \nOutbound Investment Rule was published in Q4 2024 and with the incoming U.S. Administration, there is the potential for \nfurther sanctions, in addition to trade measures against China in 2025. \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 84, "text": " \n \n52  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisks and Opportunities \nAnnual Report 2024 \nRisks \nDeutsche Bank manages these sanctions with enhanced communications, guidance and operational support led by AFC’s \nSanctions & Screening team. Further DB has updated its Sanctions Policy thereby mandating a further reduction of \nexposure to countries like Russia and Belarus. The Sanctions Policy will enter into force in Q1 2025. In addition, transactions \nare filtered, client and counterparty data is screened, trade in sanctioned financial instruments is restricted, goods and \ncommodities (such as oil) subject to trade finance restrictions are screened in a risk-based approach and further measures \nsuch as rejecting or freezing a transaction, restricting client activities, exiting a client relationship or obtaining required \nregulatory authorizations are taken. Noting the potential escalation in geo-political tensions between the U.S. and China \nDB is reviewing appetite statements in place, and governance for overseeing this activity. This involves incorporating the \nrecent U.S. Outbound Investment Rule considerations. \nRisk management policies, procedures and methods \nDeutsche Bank has devoted significant resources to develop its risk management policies, procedures and methods, \nincluding with respect to market, credit, liquidity, operational as well as reputational and model risk. However, the bank \nmay not be fully effective in mitigating its risk exposures in all economic or market environments or against all types of risk, \nincluding risks that the bank fails to identify or anticipate. Where the Group uses models to calculate risk-weighted assets \nfor regulatory purposes, potential deficiencies may also lead regulators to impose a recalibration of input parameters or a \ncomplete review of the model. \nNonetheless, the risk management techniques and strategies have not been and may in the future not be fully effective in \nmitigating the bank’s risk exposure in all economic market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that it \nfails to identify or anticipate. Some of the bank’s quantitative tools and metrics for managing risk are based upon its use of \nobserved historical market behavior. The bank applies statistical and other tools to these observations to arrive at \nquantifications of its risk exposures. In a financial crisis, the financial markets may experience extreme levels of volatility \n(rapid changes in price direction) and the breakdown of historically observed correlations (the extent to which prices move \nin tandem) across asset classes, compounded by extremely limited liquidity. In such a volatile market environment, the \nbank’s risk management tools and metrics may fail to predict important risk exposures. In addition, Deutsche Bank’s \nquantitative modeling does not take all risks into account and makes numerous assumptions regarding the overall \nenvironment, which may not be borne out by events. As a result, risk exposures have arisen and could continue to arise \nfrom factors the bank did not anticipate or correctly evaluate in its models. This has limited and could continue to limit the \nbank’s ability to manage its risks especially in light of geopolitical developments, many of the outcomes of which are \ncurrently unforeseeable. The bank’s losses thus have been and may in the future be significantly greater than the historical \nmeasures indicate. \nIn addition, the bank’s more qualitative approach to managing those risks not taken into account by the quantitative \nmethods could also prove insufficient, exposing the bank to material unanticipated losses. Also, if existing or potential \ncustomers or counterparties believe its risk management is inadequate, they could take their business elsewhere or seek \nto limit their transactions with the bank. This could harm the bank’s reputation as well as its revenues and profits. See \n“Management Report: Risk Report” in the Annual Report 2024 for a more detailed discussion of the policies, procedures \nand methods the bank uses to identify, monitor and manage its risks. \nThird Party Vendor Management  \nFinancial institutions rely on third-party service providers for a range of services, some of which support their critical \noperations. These dependencies have grown in recent years as part of the increasing trend in digitalization of the financial \nservices sector which can bring multiple benefits including flexibility, innovation and improved operational resilience. \nHowever, if not properly managed, disruption to critical services or service providers could pose risks to financial \ninstitutions, and in some cases, financial stability.  \nThe regulatory framework for managing third party risk continues to evolve and becomes increasingly complex as \nregulators seek to address various objectives. There are two main areas of focus including how financial institutions \nmanage their third-party risks and how to address the systemic risks caused by concentration of services provided by \ncritical third parties. \nDeutsche Bank has a well-established approach to Third Party Risk Management; from a clear policy and procedure \nthrough to centralized risk process for businesses to use when engaging with third parties. To respond to the increasing \nregulatory demand, Deutsche Bank is continuously enhancing the bank’s control environment. In 2024, the bank \nconcluded a key transformational project which has delivered improved efficiency, a more proportionate approach, real \ntime monitoring and better culture of awareness to protect the bank from third party risk. \nWhen using third-party service providers, the bank remains fully responsible and accountable for complying with all the \nregulatory obligations, including the ability to oversee the outsourcing of critical or important functions. The bank may \nface risks of material losses or reputational damage if third parties fail to provide services as agreed with the bank and/or \nin line with regulatory requirements.  \n"}

These assets are tested for impairment, or their useful lives \nreaffirmed at least annually. This includes the testing in relation to software impairments. \nThe determination of the recoverable amount in the impairment assessment of non-financial assets requires estimates \nbased on quoted market prices, prices of comparable businesses, present value or other valuation techniques, or a \ncombination thereof, necessitating management to make subjective judgments and assumptions. These estimates and \nassumptions could result in significant differences to the amounts reported if underlying circumstances were to change. \nImpairments of goodwill and other intangible assets have had and may have a material adverse effect on profitability and \nresults of operations. \nPension Obligations  \nDeutsche Bank sponsors a number of post-employment benefit plans on behalf of its employees, including defined benefit \nplans. For further details on Deutsche Bank’s employee benefit plans see Note 33 – “Employee Benefits” in the \nconsolidated financial statements.  \nThe bank develops and maintain guidelines for governance and risk management, including funding, asset allocation and \nactuarial assumption setting. In this regard, risk management means the management and control of risks for the bank \nrelated to market developments (e.g., interest rate, credit spread, price inflation), asset investment, regulatory or legislative \nrequirements, as well as monitoring demographic changes (e.g., longevity). To the extent that pension plans are funded, \nthe assets held mitigate some of the liability risks, but introduce investment risk. In its key pension countries, the bank’s \nlargest post-employment benefit plan risk exposures relate to potential changes in credit spreads, interest rates, price \ninflation, longevity risk and liquidity risk, although these have been partially mitigated through the investment strategy \nadopted. Overall, the bank seeks to minimize the impact of pensions on its financial position from market movements, \nsubject to balancing the trade-offs involved in financing post-employment benefits, regulatory capital and constraints \nfrom local funding or accounting requirements. \nThe bank’s investment objective in funding the plans and its obligations in respect of them is to protect the bank from \nadverse impacts of its defined benefit pension plans on key financial metrics. The bank seeks to allocate plan assets closely \nto the market risk factor exposures of the pension liability to interest rates, credit spreads and inflation and, thereby, plan \nassets broadly reflect the underlying risk profile and currency of the pension obligations. \nTo the extent that the factors that drive the bank’s pension liabilities move in a manner adverse to the bank, or that its \nassumptions regarding key variables prove incorrect, or that funding of the pension liabilities does not sufficiently hedge \nthose liabilities, the bank could be required to make additional contributions or be exposed to actuarial or accounting \nlosses in respect of its pension plans.  \nIn Germany, the Group is a member of the BVV Versicherungsverein des Bankgewerbes a.G. (BVV), a multi-employer \ndefined benefit plan, together with other financial institutions. In line with industry practice, the Group accounts for it as a \ndefined contribution plan since insufficient information is available to identify assets and liabilities relating to the Group’s \ncurrent and former employees, primarily because the BVV does not fully allocate plan assets to beneficiaries nor to \nmember companies. The Group may be exposed to significant financial risk should the residual risks related to this multi-\nemployer defined benefit plan materialize. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 86, "text": " \n \n54  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisks and Opportunities \nAnnual Report 2024 \nRisks \nDeferred Tax Assets  \nThe bank recognizes deferred tax assets for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the \nfinancial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, unused tax losses and \nunused tax credits. To the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or \na portion of the deferred tax assets to be utilized, the bank must reduce the carrying amounts. Each quarter, the bank re-\nevaluates its estimate related to deferred tax assets, which can change from period to period and requires significant \nmanagement judgment. Furthermore, deferred tax assets are measured based on tax rates that are expected to apply in \nthe period that the asset is realized, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted \nat the balance sheet date. If for example, the U.S. were to enact a reduction in the corporate income tax rate, which going \nforward would positively impact the bank’s effective tax rate, the bank’s deferred tax assets in the U.S. would have to be \nremeasured at the lower tax rate. Reductions in the amount of deferred tax assets from a change in estimate or a change \nin tax rate have had and may in the future have material adverse effects on its profitability, equity and financial condition. \nTechnology, Data and Innovation  \nDigital Innovation may offer market entry opportunities for new competitors such as cross-industry entrants, global tech \ncompanies and financial technology companies. Therefore, the bank expects its businesses to have an increased need for \ninvestments in digital product and process resources to remain competitive and mitigate the risk of a potential loss of \nmarket share. \nThrough its strategic partnership with Google, Deutsche Bank is migrating applications to the Public Cloud with the goal \nof improving IT flexibility and resiliency Technology transformation requires robust governance, planning and funding and \nremains an area of significant regulatory interest in this program. Additionally, the bank must ensure adopt applicable  \nstandards of data privacy and security to protect client and bank information. Failure to do so can compromise client trust, \nlead to financial losses and result in regulatory penalties, litigation and compensation obligations. \nThe bank continually assesses and monitors emerging threats relating to the security of the bank’s operations and \ninformation. This comprises identification of and response to incidents along the bank’s supply chain, including third and \nfourth party vendors. Security breaches impacting the bank’s supply chain may not only affect the bank but also may have \nsevere cross-industry consequences. Additionally, Deutsche Bank actively tracks threats which have the potential to \nexploit security vulnerabilities, and activities by nation-state actors along with trends and developments, such as cyber \nrisks related to Artificial Intelligence technologies and potential threats that Quantum Computing poses to encryption. We \nalso continue to closely observe common attack scenarios, including ransomware, denial of service, and supply chain \nattacks. Deutsche Bank maintains insurance for cyber events. There can be no assurance that such coverage will be \nadequate to cover all losses or liabilities arising from a cyber event.  \nMitigation strategies and controls are continually adapted to address these evolving risks and the global security threat \nlandscape. For further details and more information, please refer to the Information Security chapter within the Risk \nReport. \nDeutsche Bank is continuously improving its data management strategy focusing on core processes and data sets like \ntransactional, client, and reference data. This includes developing and implementing enterprise architecture principles \nacross its core technology infrastructure. This is central to Deutsche Bank’s wider technology and data strategy, which \naims to enable business growth and efficiencies, while also enhancing the control environment. Regulators are actively \ninvolved in monitoring the bank's progress in this area. \nMajor technology transformations in the bank’s business and infrastructure areas are executed via dedicated initiatives. \nThese initiatives aim to reduce IT and business costs, improve controls, and drive revenue growth by offering new client \nfeatures or targeting client growth. However, there are risks in executing these programs, such as, talent and financial \nconstraints, dependencies on other programs and key deliverables, extended implementation timelines or adverse change \nrelated impacts activity on the control environment and functionality issues within upgraded applications or their \nunderlying technologies. These risks are carefully managed to mitigate the risk of not fully achieving expected benefits. \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 87, "text": " \n \n55  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisks and Opportunities \nAnnual Report 2024 \nRisks \nEnvironmental, social and governance \nThe impacts of rising global temperatures and the associated policy, technology and behavioral changes required to limit \nglobal warming to no greater than 1.5oc above pre-industrial levels have led to emerging sources of financial and non-\nfinancial risks. These include the physical risk impacts from extreme weather events, and transition risks as carbon-\nintensive sectors are faced with higher costs, potentially reduced demand and restricted access to financing. More rapid \nthan currently expected emergence of transition and/or physical climate risks and other environmental risks may lead to \nincreased credit and market losses as well as operational disruptions due to impacts on vendors and the bank’s own \noperations. Deutsche Bank has integrated Climate and Environmental risk considerations throughout its risk and control \nframeworks to ensure that risks are identified, monitored and managed.  \nInstances of extreme weather events have increased in frequency & severity. Recent cases of severe flash flooding in Spain, \nhurricanes in North America and wildfires in California highlight the increasing trend of damaging climate events. Although \nimpacts were contained, future extreme weather events could lead to higher credit loss provisions, property loss, rising \ninsurance costs and operational resilience risks. Extreme weather events can also impact Deutsche Bank’s revenue \ngenerating capabilities and costs, while market declines and volatility could negatively impact the value of financial \ninstruments, drive volatility in the bank’s valuation and timing differences and result in impairments of non-financial assets. \nFurthermore, financial institutions are facing increased scrutiny on climate and sustainability-related issues from \ngovernments, regulators, shareholders and other bodies (including non-governmental organizations). Banks must navigate \nan increasingly complex and heterogenous policy environment with U.S. led challenges to their collaborative efforts to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions leading to accusations of unlawful practice and anti-trust violations with potential for \nrestrictions on access to certain clients and potential litigation. In key focus is the Net Zero Banking Alliance which has \nseen the departure of U.S. peers in response to these concerns. In contrast, many organizations and individuals expect \nbanks to support the transition to a lower carbon economy, to limit nature-related risks such as biodiversity and habitat \nloss, and to protect human rights. This increased scrutiny includes more extensive and prescriptive ESG disclosure \nrequirements such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). The emergence of significantly diverging \nESG regulatory and/or disclosure standards across jurisdictions could lead to higher costs of compliance and risks of failing \nto meet requirements. Of note is the interconnectedness between transition, other environmental, and social risks where \nsupporting the transition could lead to increased demand for transition minerals which are obtained via mining. \nDeutsche Bank is rated by a number of ESG rating providers, with the ratings increasingly utilized as criteria to determine \neligibility for sustainable investments and to assess management of ESG risks and opportunities. The methodologies and \nscores used by the different providers can lead to significant divergence in results. Should the bank’s ratings lag peers, or \nmaterially deteriorate, this could lead to negative reputational impacts and reduced investor demand for equity/debt. \nImproved ratings may have the opposite effect. \nData, methodologies and industry standards for measuring and assessing climate and other environmental risks are still \nevolving or, in certain cases, are not yet available. This, combined with a lack of comprehensive and consistent climate and \nother environmental risk disclosures by its clients means that the bank, in line with the wider industry, is heavily reliant on \nproxy estimates and/or proprietary approaches for its own climate and environmental risk management disclosures. The \nhigh degree of uncertainty that this creates increases the risk that third parties may assert that the bank’s sustainability-\nrelated disclosures constitute greenwashing. Positively, enhanced disclosure requirements for our clients will reduce \nreliance on proxy estimates and/or proprietary approaches going forwards. \nWhile Deutsche Bank remains committed to the targets outlined in its Sustainability Deep Dive, the bank may face \nheadwinds in achieving its aim for € 500 billion in cumulative sustainable financing and investment volumes through the \nend of 2025. If ambitions or targets are missed, this could impact, among other things, revenues and the reputation of the \nbank. In addition, scarcity of green and social assets may reduce Deutsche Bank’s ability to issue compliant funding. In \naddition, competition for the financing of green and social assets may reduce Deutsche Bank’s ability to issue funding that \nqualifies for inclusion. Additionally, an economy transitioning at a slower pace may result in significant deviations from the \nbank’s net zero-aligned emissions pathways toward its targets. This would come to reduce transition risk in the short to \nmedium term but increase it significantly over the longer term. The bank continues to consider its net zero targets as one \nof the key climate risk management tools and recently extended its net zero target framework to include the Commercial \nAviation sector. Certain jurisdictions have begun to develop anti-ESG measures including requiring financial institutions \nthat wish to do business with them to certify their non-adherence to aspects of the transition agenda. Failing to comply \nwith these requirements may result in the termination of existing business and the inability to conduct new business with \nthose jurisdictions, while complying may lead to reputational risks and potential lawsuits. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 88, "text": "56 \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisks and Opportunities \nAnnual Report 2024 \nOpportunities \nOpportunities \nMacroeconomic and market conditions \nShould economic conditions, such as GDP growth, levels of unemployment, the interest rate environment and competitive \nconditions in the financial services industry improve beyond currently forecasted levels, this could result in higher \nrevenues. These impacts may only be partially offset by additional costs, therefore improving the Group’s ability to meet \nits financial targets. At the same time, potentially higher inflation, interest rates and market volatility could present a \nnumber of opportunities, such as increased revenues from higher trading flows amid private, corporate and institutional \ncustomers repositioning their portfolios, higher net interest income as well as higher margins on lending across the Group’s \nbalance sheet. \nIn particular, opportunities could arise if the macroeconomic environment in our home market Germany improves in the \nwake of the early Bundestag election in February 2025. If the next federal government accomplishes a relaxation of the \nconstitutional debt brake and/or the implementation of growth enhancing structural reforms, e.g. to reduce electricity \nprices or the administrative and tax burden of businesses, Germany’s economic growth prospects would improve over the \nmedium term. Some initial positive effects on the bank’s business environment (e.g. from additional fiscal spending or \nhigher confidence) could possibly materialize over the short term during 2025.  \nA substantial proportion of the assets and liabilities on the Group’s balance sheet are of financial instruments carried at \nfair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. If market conditions improve or interest rates \ndecline, this could result in an increase in the fair value of certain financial instruments. As a result of such changes, the \nGroup may realize gains in the future. \nGeopolitics \nWhile rising geopolitical risk creates uncertainty which undermines the global growth outlook and leads to increased \nfragmentation of the business environment, Deutsche Bank could benefit from supporting clients to de-risk their supply \nchains and rebalance their global footprint if the fragmentation of the international trade order accelerates. Should \ngeopolitical risk unexpectedly subside, the outlook for global growth could improve beyond the bank’s assumptions with \npositive implications for revenues and risk metrics. \nRegulatory change \nRegulatory change can encourage banks to provide better products or services that can offer opportunities for \ndifferentiation in the marketplace. For example, as reporting standards continue to develop and improve for sustainable \nfinance, the market may evolve to embrace sustainable finance initiatives more broadly. As clients and the market adopt \nsustainable finance related initiatives, the Group may have the opportunity to further differentiate the bank by enhancing \nthe services provided to its clients. \nStrategy \nDeutsche Bank’s Global Hausbank strategy outlines the bank’s approach to materially improve returns to shareholders \nover time and how best deploy the balance sheet as well as other resources, in a way that is consistent with the client \nfranchise and risk appetite of the bank. As such, the implementation of the Group’s strategy may create further \nopportunities if implemented to a greater extent or under more favorable conditions than anticipated. This includes \npotential benefits from better than planned macroeconomic, market and geopolitical conditions or advantageous changes \nin the competitive environment, such as the retreat of traditional and emerging, non-banking competitors in selected \nmarkets.  \nIf businesses and processes improve beyond Deutsche Bank’s planned assumptions and cost efficiencies can be realized \nsooner or to a greater extent than forecasted, this could also positively impact the results of operations. The progress could \nbe further stimulated if markets react favorably to Deutsche Bank’s rating upgrades and sustained revenue performance. \nThis could in turn reduce funding costs and further amplify the bank’s profitability. \n"}

Deutsche Bank’s expects its over 150-year heritage, global network, \nmarket expertise, outstanding risk management and comprehensive product range to support growth and targeted \ninvestments with focus on becoming sustainably profitable while increasing operational efficiencies and maintaining \ncapital discipline.  \nWithin the Corporate Bank, Deutsche Bank sees multi-faceted opportunities across a market leading franchise that \nleverages Corporate Bank’s global footprint and coverage model. Deutsche Bank expects to grow revenues by combining \nrisk management solutions with treasury platform capabilities and establishing the Corporate Bank as a key partner to \nsupport its clients’ energy transformation, building on its position in Europe and expanding further into APAC.  \nThe Investment Bank continues to be a global leader in fixed income and financing products, and Deutsche Bank is focused \non consolidating this position and maintaining the market share gained. To achieve this, combined with the strength of the \nOrigination and Advisory platform, the focus of the division is targeted on specific investment into areas of growth in \nexisting and adjacent businesses to enhance and diversify the product offering. Meanwhile, the Investment Bank continues \nto focus on the optimization of cost and capital across the portfolio, and additional enhancements to the control \nenvironment. In addition, an increased focus upon the efficiency of the division’s client coverage intends to increase the \nstrength and depth of relationships across the global client base. \nFor the Private Bank, focus remains on German retail, international retail and business clients, and on seeking growth \npredominantly within advisory areas. With respect to wealth management activities, the Group sees growth opportunities \nparticularly in EMEA and APAC. \nFor Asset Management, comprising of DWS legal entities, DWS continues to execute the publicly stated strategy, which \naims to maintain leadership in mature asset classes and selectively grow other regions and products, in order to cement \nits status as a leading asset manager. Growth areas include revenue opportunities from further asset shifts towards Passive \ninvestments and Alternative products. \nDeutsche Bank continues to focus on sustainability throughout the bank and has seen opportunities for growth in this \nspace across all the bank’s core businesses as clients’ response to climate change gains further traction. Given strong client \nappetite, Deutsche Bank continues to see sustainable finance as a key opportunity and area of investment. As part of the \nbroader efforts to develop a risk appetite strategy to manage climate risk, the bank sees opportunities to support clients, \nfor example, in developing credible decarbonization strategies and support their transition. \nIndividuals and institutions, including clients and non-clients of the bank, increasingly view ESG-related opportunities as \nsignificant for long-term returns and the bank believes this could become a key differentiator. In this regard, inclusion of \nESG factors in the investment processes or decision-making process for awarding business mandates across businesses is \ngrowing. As such, Deutsche Bank plans to develop and provide financial products or investment possibilities that can help \nboth the bank and its clients to achieve common ESG goals and advance Deutsche Bank’s holistic ESG strategy. More \nbroadly, the bank believes that advancing ESG activities can lead to both additional revenues opportunities as well as an \nimproved brand and stakeholder perception. \nAdditionally, a shared and strong firm-wide risk and control culture, enabled by technology, analytics and the bank’s deep \nrisk expertise, may, in parts provide the competitive edge needed to support the growth strategy of Deutsche Bank’s \nbusinesses. \nOverall, there are opportunities for Deutsche Bank to gain market share and grow its client base via supporting client needs \nfor financing, advice, and risk management. \n \n \n"}

The Group’s global reach allows it to scale products quickly \nand efficiently across geographies. At the same time, the bank’s customers will benefit from products and services being \ndeveloped and brought to market more quickly in the future.  \nThe bank´s ongoing strategic partnership with Google Cloud demonstrates its commitment to embrace new technologies. \nApplication migrations to Google Cloud, e.g. the SAP HANA finance platform which includes the bank´s general ledger, are \nexpected to bring along a number of benefits including performance, scalability, stability and security of the cloud \nenvironment.  \nThe bank is collaborating with Google, Microsoft and other technology providers on the early adoption of new AI \ntechnologies and on ‘Responsible AI’ for the banking industry. The bank is evaluating such technologies in a prudent and \nresponsible way to ensure it understands and mitigates risks that may arise before deploying them into production. The \nbank’s global reach allows it to scale products quickly and efficiently across geographies, while its customers will benefit \nfrom new products and services being developed and brought to market more quickly in the future. Deutsche Bank’s \napproach is to maximize benefits from AI without compromising on risk. It has created an Artificial Intelligence Oversight \nForum to ensure that there is appropriate monitoring and risk assessment of AI solutions and their alignment with the \nbank’s strategic goals. In 2024, the bank has already implemented a number of AI solutions, including a document \nprocessing solution that leverages Generative AI to significantly reduce document handling time. Another GenAI solution \ncalled “dbLumina” has been implemented to allow business subject matter experts to curate, fine-tune, and control \ncontent from large bodies of knowledge in a consistent and reliable manner. In addition to implementing specific AI \nsolutions, the bank is also adopting more generic AI solutions with a controlled roll out of the Microsoft Copilot. \nIn addition, technology is creating new sets of digital assets and money, such as central bank digital currencies, tokenized \ndeposits, stablecoins and electronic securities. These may facilitate cheaper, faster, and more efficient financial \ntransactions, while also unlocking new use cases. Deutsche Bank in very active discussions on both wholesale and retail \nCentral Bank Digital Currency solutions globally, but particularly within Europe. It participated in the Wholesale central \nbank money settlement trials with the ECB. It is also collaborating with the Bank for International Settlements to explore \nthe benefits that tokenization can provide wholesale cross-border payments.  \nDeutsche Bank reviews opportunities to leverage the benefits in underlying digital asset technology to address customer \nneeds within the bank’s regulatory and risk appetite frameworks. By maintaining a cautious and highly selective approach, \nthe bank aims to leverage new technology in a way that safely benefits clients, but this approach could also lead to missed \nopportunities. \nEnvironmental, social and governance \nThe transition to a lower carbon economy presents multiple opportunities to support clients on their pathways to net zero \nthrough the provision of sustainable finance and transition expertise. In 2023, Deutsche Bank published its Initial Transition \nPlan which consolidates the bank’s definitions, methodologies, targets and achievements on its path to net-zero by 2050 \nin a single publication. Overall, coupled with the active management of the Group’s carbon footprint via its net zero target \nregime, this can lead to both revenue opportunities as well as improved stakeholder perceptions.\n"}

The Group measures key risks inherent to the \nrespective business models through the total economic capital metric, which captures the business division’s risk profile \nand considers cross-risk effects at Group level. \nCorporate Bank’s risk profile mainly arises from the products and services offered in Corporate Treasury Services (including \nTrade Finance, Lending and Corporate Cash Management), Strategic Corporate Lending and Business Banking. Economic \ncapital demand in these segments arises largely from credit risk. \nInvestment Bank’s risk profile is dominated by its financing and trading activities, which give rise to all major risk types. \nCredit risk in the Investment Bank is broadly distributed across business units but most prominent in Fixed Income & \nCurrencies and Leveraged Debt Capital Markets. Market risk arises mainly from trading and market making activities. \nPrivate Bank’s risk profile comprises credit risks from business with German and international retail clients, business clients \nand wealth management clients as well as non-trading market risks from modelling of client deposits and credit spread \nrisk. \nAsset Management, as a fiduciary asset manager, invests money on behalf of clients. As such, the main risk drivers are non-\nfinancial. The economic capital demand for market risk is mainly driven by non-trading market risks, which arise from \nguaranteed products and co-investments in the funds. \nCorporate & Other’s risk profile embeds a range of different risk drivers including those pertaining to Treasury, certain \ncorporate items, and legacy portfolios. The economic capital demand mainly comprises of non-trading market risk from \ninterest rate risk in Treasury, structural foreign exchange risk, pension risk and equity compensation risk, credit risk from \nTreasury’s investments, strategic risk from tax-related risks and software asset risks and operational risk from legacy \nportfolios. \nThe table below shows Deutsche Bank’s overall risk position as measured by the economic capital demand calculated for \ncredit, market, operational and strategic risk for the dates specified.

Risks can be financial and non-financial and include on \nand off-balance sheet risks. Deutsche Bank’s objective is to create sustainable value in the interests of the company taking \ninto consideration shareholders, employees and other company related stakeholders. The risk management framework \ncontributes to this by aligning planned and actual risk taking with risk appetite as expressed by the Management Board, \nwhile being in line with available capital and liquidity. \nDeutsche Bank’s risk management framework consists of various components, which include the established internal \ncontrol mechanisms. Principles and standards are set for each component: \n– Organizational structures must follow the Three Lines of Defense (“3LoD”) model with a clear definition of roles and \nresponsibilities for all risk types \n–\nThe 1st Line of Defense (“1st LoD”) refers to those roles in the Bank whose activities generate risks, whether financial\nor non-financial, and who own and are accountable for these risks. The 1st LoD manages these risks within the defined \nrisk appetite, establishes an appropriate risk governance and risk culture, and adheres to the risk type frameworks\ndefined by the 2nd Line of Defense (“2nd LoD”)\n–\nThe 2nd LoD refers to the roles in the Bank who define the risk management framework for a specific risk type. The \n2nd LoD independently assesses and challenges the implementation of the risk type framework and adherence to \nthe risk appetite, and acts as an advisor to the 1st LoD on how to identify, assess and manage risks.\n–\nThe 3rd Line of Defense (“3rd LoD”) is Group Audit, which is accountable for providing independent and objective \nassurance on the adequacy of the design, operating effectiveness and efficiency of the risk management system and\nsystems of internal control \n– Every employee must act as a risk manager consistent with the bank’s risk appetite, risk management standards and\nvalues \n– The Management Board approved risk appetite must be cascaded and adhered to across all dimensions of the Group,\nwith appropriate consequences in the event of a breach \n– Risks must be identified and assessed\n– Risks must be actively managed including appropriate risk mitigation and effective internal control systems\n– Risks must be measured and reported using accurate, complete and timely data using approved models\n– Regular stress tests must be performed against adverse scenarios and appropriate crisis response planning must be\nestablished \nThe Group promotes a strong risk culture where every employee must fully understand and take a holistic view of the risks \nwhich could result from their actions, understand the consequences and manage them appropriately against the risk \nappetite of the bank. The bank expects employees to exhibit behaviors that support a strong risk culture in line with the \nbank’s Code of Conduct. To promote this, Deutsche Bank’s policies require that risks taken (including against risk appetite) \nmust be taken into account during the bank’s performance assessment and compensation processes. This expectation \ncontinues to be reinforced through communications campaigns and mandatory training courses for all DB employees. In \naddition, Management Board members and senior management frequently communicate the importance of a strong risk \nculture to support a consistent tone from the top. \nDeutsche Bank’s risk management and internal control system is described in more detail in Deutsche Bank’s Pillar 3 report \n(specifically in the section “Risk management objectives and policies, Enterprise Risk”). The risk management and internal \ncontrol system also covers sustainability-related objectives (as outlined in the “Sustainability Statement”). \nThe Management Board is of the opinion that a risk management framework and internal control system has been \nestablished which is, in its entirety, appropriate and effective for the bank’s business model and risk profile. \n"}

The strategic plan aims to create a holistic perspective on \ncapital, funding, and risk under risk-return considerations. This process translates long-term strategic targets into \nmeasurable short- to medium-term financial targets and enables intra-year performance monitoring and management. \nThereby the Group aims to identify growth options by considering the risks involved and the allocation of available capital \nresources to drive sustainable performance. Risk-specific portfolio strategies complement this framework and allow for an \nin-depth implementation of the risk strategy on portfolio level, addressing risk specifics including risk concentrations.  \nThe strategic planning process consists of two phases: a top-down target setting and a bottom-up substantiation. \nIn a first phase – the top-down target setting – Deutsche Bank’s key targets for profit and loss (including revenues and \ncosts), capital supply, capital demand as well as leverage, funding and liquidity are defined and discussed for the group \nand the key business areas. In this process step, the targets for the next five years are based on the global macro-economic \noutlook and the expected regulatory framework. Subsequently, the targets are challenged and approved by the \nManagement Board.  \nIn a second phase, the top-down targets are substantiated bottom-up by detailed business unit plans, which consist of a \nmonth by month operative plan for year one; years two and three are planned per quarter and years four and five are annual \nplans. The proposed bottom-up plans are reviewed and challenged by Finance and Risk and are discussed individually with \nthe respective business heads. Thereby, the specifics of the business are considered, and concrete targets agreed in line \nwith the bank’s strategic direction. The bottom-up phase includes the preparation of plans for key legal entities to review \nlocal risk and capitalization levels. Stress tests complement the strategic plan to consider the resilience of the plan against \nadverse market conditions.  \nThe resulting Strategic and Capital Plan is presented to the Management Board for discussion and approval. The final plan \nis furthermore presented to the Supervisory Board. \nThe Strategic and Capital Plan is designed to support the Groups’ vision of being a leading German bank with strong \nEuropean roots and a global network and aims to ensure: \n– Balanced risk adjusted performance across business areas and units \n– High risk management standards with focus on risk concentrations \n– Compliance with regulatory requirements \n– Strong capital and liquidity position \n– Stable funding and liquidity strategy allowing for business planning within the liquidity risk appetite and regulatory \nrequirements \nThe Strategic and Capital Planning process allows to: \n– set earnings and key risk and capital adequacy targets considering the bank’s strategic focus and business plans \n– assess the capital adequacy with regard to internal and external requirements (i.e., economic capital and regulatory \ncapital) \n– apply appropriate stress test analyses to assess the impact on capital demand, capital supply and liquidity \nAll externally communicated financial targets are monitored on an ongoing basis in appropriate management committees. \nAny projected shortfall versus targets is discussed together with potential mitigating strategies with the aim to ensure that \nthe Group remains on track to achieve the targets.

The normative \ninternal perspective refers to a multi-year assessment of the ability to fulfil all capital-related legal requirements and \nsupervisory demands. The economic internal perspective refers to an internal process using internal economic capital \ndemand models and an internal economic capital supply definition. Both perspectives focus on maintaining the continuity \nof Deutsche Bank on an ongoing basis under a baseline and adverse scenario. \nStress testing \nDeutsche Bank has implemented a stress test framework to satisfy internal as well as external stress test requirements. \nThe internal stress tests are based on in-house developed methods and inform a variety of risk management use cases (risk \ntype specific as well as cross risk). Internal stress tests form an integral part of Deutsche Bank’s risk management \nframework complementing traditional risk measures. The cross-risk stress test framework, the Group Wide Stress Test \nFramework (GWST), serves a variety of bank management processes, in particular the strategic planning process, the \nICAAP, the risk appetite framework and tangible equity allocation to business units. Capital plan stress testing is performed \nto assess the viability of the bank’s capital plan in adverse circumstances and to demonstrate a clear link between risk \nappetite, business strategy, capital plan and stress testing. The regulatory stress tests, e.g. the EBA stress test and the US-\nbased CCAR (Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review) stress tests, are strictly following the processes and \nmethodologies as prescribed by the regulatory authorities.  \nDeutsche Bank’s internal stress tests are performed on a regular basis in order to assess the impact of severe economic \ndownturns as well as adverse bank-specific events on the bank’s risk profile and financial position. The bank’s stress testing \nframework comprises regular sensitivity-based and scenario-based approaches addressing different severities and \nregional hotspots. All material risk types are included in the stress testing activities. These activities are complemented by \nportfolio- and country-specific downside analysis as well as further regulatory requirements, such as annual reverse stress \ntests and additional stress tests requested by regulators on group or legal entity level. The applied methodologies undergo \nregular scrutiny from Deutsche Bank’s internal validation team (Model Risk Management) to ensure they correctly capture \nthe impact of a given stress scenario. In addition, the group wide stress framework is subject to regular reviews by Deutsche \nBank’s group audit function. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 103, "text": " \n \n71  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisk and capital framework \nAnnual Report 2024 \nRisk measurement and reporting systems \nThe initial phase of Deutsche Bank’s cross-risk stress test consists of defining a macroeconomic downturn scenario by ERM \nRisk Research in cooperation with business specialists through a formal governance forum, the Scenario Design Working \nGroup. ERM Risk Research monitors the political and economic developments around the world and maintains a macro-\neconomic heat map that identifies potentially harmful scenarios. Based on quantitative models and expert judgments, \neconomic parameters such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, GDP growth or unemployment rates are set \naccordingly and define the narrative under which the bank’s solvency position is assessed. The scenario parameters are \ntranslated into specific risk drivers by subject matter experts in the risk units. Based on the bank’s internal model framework \nfor stress testing, the following major metrics are calculated under stress: risk-weighted assets, impacts on profit and loss \nand economic capital by risk type. These results are aggregated at the Group level, and key metrics such as the CET 1 ratio, \nTotal Capital ratio, Economic Capital Adequacy ratio, MREL ratio and Leverage Ratio under stress are derived. Stress \nimpacts on the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and other Liquidity indicators are also considered. The time-horizon of \ninternal stress tests is between one and five years, depending on the use case and scenario assumptions. The Stress Test \nWorking Group (STWG) reviews the final stress results followed by selected presentations to the Enterprise Risk Committee \n(ERC). After comparing these results against the bank’s defined risk appetite, a specific mitigation strategy may be \ndeveloped and applied to remediate the stress impacts in case of risk appetite threshold breaches. The stress results also \nfeed into the recovery planning which is crucial for the recoverability of the bank in times of crisis. The outcome is \npresented to senior management up to the Management Board to raise awareness on the highest level as it provides key \ninsights into specific business vulnerabilities and contributes to the overall risk profile assessment of the bank.  \nThe group wide stress tests performed in 2024 indicated that the bank’s capitalization together with available mitigation \nmeasures as defined in the Group Recovery Plan is adequate to reach the internally set stress exit levels.  \nThe cross-risk reverse stress test leverages the GWST framework and is typically performed annually in order to challenge \nDeutsche Bank’s business model by determining scenarios which would cause the bank to become unviable. Such a reverse \nstress test is based on a hypothetical macroeconomic scenario enriched by idiosyncratic events based on the top risks \nmonitored by each risk type. Comparing the non-viability scenario to the current economic environment, the probability \nof occurrence of such a hypothetical stress scenario is considered to be extremely low. Given this, it is the bank’s view that \nits business continuity is not at risk. \nIn 2024, the bank has performed multi-year stress tests as part of the annual strategic planning process for 2024 using \ntwo adverse heatmap scenarios, namely a “EU led hard landing scenario” and a “Upside rates and inflation shock” scenario.  \nIn addition to the GWST that includes all material risk types and major revenue streams, Deutsche Bank has individual \nstress test programs in place for all relevant risk metrics in line with regulatory requirements. The relevant stress test \nprograms are described in the sections about the individual risk management methods. \nDeutsche Bank’s core U.S. subsidiary, DB USA Corporation, also took part in a major regulatory stress test in 2024 i.e. the \nUS-based CCAR stress test, as implemented pursuant to the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act. In the CCAR stress test, the Federal \nReserve (FRB) disclosed the stress capital depletion for DB USA Corporation and DWS USA Corporation; the outcome of \nwhich showed that each entity remains very well-capitalized even after withstanding a hypothetical severe stress \nenvironment.  \nIn 2024, the bank has continued to enhance its internal climate stress testing capabilities, extending its framework to \ninclude physical risk and long-term transition risk scenarios across global portfolios. In addition, all relevant risk types with \nmaterial climate risk exposure are now covered. The results of the stress test are integrated into relevant processes, \nincluding risk appetite, business planning and ICAAP. \nRisk measurement and reporting systems  \nOverview \nDeutsche Bank’s risk measurement systems support regulatory reporting and external disclosures, as well as internal \nmanagement reporting across all risk types. The risk infrastructure incorporates the relevant legal entities and business \ndivisions and provides the basis for reporting on risk positions, capital adequacy and limit, threshold, or target utilization \nto the relevant functions on a regular and ad-hoc basis. Established units within the CFO and CRO function assume \nresponsibility for measurement, analysis and reporting of risk while promoting sufficient quality and integrity of risk-related \ndata and consider, where relevant, the principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting as per the Basel \nCommittee on Banking Supervision's regulation number 239 (“BCBS 239”). The Group’s risk management systems are \nreviewed by Group Audit following a risk-based audit approach. \n"}

Deutsche Bank \ndesignates a subset of those as “Key Risk Metrics” that represent the most critical ones for which the Bank places an \nappetite, limit, threshold or target at Group level and/or are reported routinely to senior management for discussion or \ndecision making. The identified Key Risk Metrics include Capital Adequacy and Liquidity metrics; further details can be \nfound in the section “Key risk metrics”. \nKey risk reports \nWhile a large number of reports are used across the Bank, Deutsche Bank designates a subset of these as “Key Risk Reports” \nthat are critical to support Deutsche Bank’s Risk Management Framework through the provision of risk information to \nsenior management and therefore enable the relevant governing bodies to monitor, steer and control the Bank’s risk taking \nactivities effectively. To ensure that Key Risk Reports meet recipients’ requirements, report producing functions regularly \ncheck whether the Key Risk Reports are clear and useful. \nThe main reports on risk and capital management that are used to provide Deutsche Bank’s central governance bodies \nwith information relating to the Group risk profile are the following: \n– The monthly Risk and Capital Profile report is a Cross-Risk report, provides a comprehensive view of Deutsche Bank’s \nrisk profile and is used to inform the ERC, the Group Risk Committee as well as the Management Board and subsequently \nthe Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board; the Risk and Capital Profile includes Risk Type specific and Business-\nAligned overviews and Enterprise-wide risk topics; it also includes updates on Key Group Risk Appetite Metrics and \nother Key Portfolio Risk Type Control Metrics as well as updates on Key Risk Developments, highlighting areas of \nparticular interest with updates on corresponding risk management strategies \n– The Weekly Risk Report is a weekly briefing covering high-level topical issues across key risk areas and is submitted \nevery Friday to the Members of the Enterprise Risk Committee, the Group Risk Committee and the Management Board \nand subsequently to the Members of the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board; the Weekly Risk Report is \ncharacterized by the ad-hoc nature of its commentary as well as coverage of themes and focuses on more volatile risk \nmetrics \n– Deutsche Bank runs several Group-wide macroeconomic stress tests. A monthly Risk Appetite scenario serves the \npurpose to set and regularly monitor the bank’s stress loss appetite; in addition, there are topical scenarios which are \nreported to and discussed in the Enterprise Risk Committee and escalated to the Group Risk Committee if deemed \nnecessary; the stressed key performance indicators are benchmarked against the Group Risk Appetite thresholds \nWhile the above reports are used at a Group level to monitor and review the risk profile of Deutsche Bank holistically, there \nare other, supplementing standard and ad-hoc management reports, including for Risk Types or Focus Portfolios, which \nare used to monitor and control the risk profile. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 105, "text": " \n \n73  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisk and capital framework \nAnnual Report 2024 \nRecovery and resolution planning \nRecovery and resolution planning \nIn the EU, the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRM Regulation) and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive \n(BRRD) aim at reducing the likelihood of another financial crisis, enhance the resilience of institutions under stress, and \neventually support the long-term stability of the financial systems without exposing taxpayers’ money to losses. \nIn line with the provisions of the SRM Regulation and the BRRD (which were mainly implemented in Germany by the \nGerman Recovery and Resolution Act (Sanierungs- und Abwicklungsgesetz, SAG)), Deutsche Bank maintains a recovery \nand resolution planning framework designed to identify and manage the impact of adverse events in a timely and \ncoordinated manner. \nThe bank maintains a group recovery plan specifying measures to restore the financial position following a significant \ndeterioration of its financial situation. The group recovery plan is updated at least annually and approved by the \nManagement Board. \nThe group resolution plan on the other hand is prepared by the resolution authorities, rather than by the bank itself. \nDeutsche Bank works closely with the Single Resolution Board and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht \n(BaFin) who establish the group resolution plan for Deutsche Bank, which is currently based on a single point of entry open \nbank bail-in as the preferred resolution strategy. Under the single point of entry bail-in strategy, the parent entity Deutsche \nBank AG would be recapitalized through a write-down and/or conversion to equity of capital instruments (Common Equity \nTier 1, Additional Tier 1, Tier 2) and other eligible liabilities in order to stabilize the group. Within one month after the \napplication of the bail-in tool to recapitalize an institution, the BRRD (as implemented in the SAG) requires such institution \nto prepare a business reorganization plan, addressing the causes of failure and aiming to restore the institution's long-term \nviability. To further support and improve operational continuity of the bank for resolution planning purposes, Deutsche \nBank has completed additional preparations, such as adding termination stay clauses into client financial agreements \ngoverned by non-EU law and including continuity provisions into key service agreements. Financial contracts and service \nagreements governed by EU law are already covered by statutory laws which prevent termination solely due to any \nresolution measure. \nThe BRRD requires banks in EU member states to maintain minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities to \nmake resolution credible by establishing sufficient loss absorption and recapitalization capacity. Apart from MREL-\nrequirements, Deutsche Bank, as a global systemically important bank, is subject to global minimum standards for Total \nLoss-Absorbing Capacity, which set out strict requirements for the amount and eligibility of instruments to be maintained \nfor bail-in purposes. In particular, TLAC instruments must be subordinated (including so-called senior non-preferred debt, \nbut also in the form of regulatory capital instruments) to other senior liabilities. This ensures that a bail-in would be applied \nfirst to equity and TLAC instruments, which must be exhausted before a bail-in may affect other senior (preferred) liabilities \nsuch as senior preferred plain vanilla bonds, debt instruments that are structured, deposits and derivatives. \nIn the United States, Deutsche Bank AG is required under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act), as amended, to prepare and submit to the Federal Reserve Board and the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) either a full or targeted resolution plan (the U.S. Resolution Plan) on a \ntimeline prescribed by such agencies. The U.S. Resolution Plan must demonstrate that the Deutsche Bank AG has the \nability to execute and implement a strategy for the orderly resolution of its designated U.S. material entities and \noperations. For foreign-based companies subject to these resolution planning requirements such as Deutsche Bank AG, \nthe U.S. Resolution Plan relates only to subsidiaries, branches, agencies and businesses that are domiciled in or whose \nactivities are carried out in whole or in material part in the United States. Deutsche Bank’s U.S. Resolution Plan describes \nthe single point of entry strategy for Deutsche Bank’s U.S. material entities and operations and prescribes that DB USA \nCorporation, one of the bank’s intermediate holding companies, would provide liquidity and capital support to its U.S. \nmaterial entity subsidiaries and ensure their solvent wind-down outside of applicable resolution proceedings.  \nDeutsche Bank filed its first ‘targeted’ U.S. Resolution Plan on December 17, 2021, which described the core elements of \nDeutsche Bank’s U.S. resolution strategy, such as capital, liquidity, and recapitalization strategies, as well as how Deutsche \nBank has integrated lessons learned from its response to the COVID-19 pandemic into its resolution planning process. On \nDecember 16, 2022, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and the FDIC (Agencies) announced the results of their review of \nDeutsche Bank’s 2021 U.S. Resolution Plan, as well as those of other banks, and did not find any shortcomings or \ndeficiencies in Deutsche Bank’s plan. In their feedback letter to Deutsche Bank, the Agencies noted areas where further \nprogress will help improve resolvability. Joint guidance was finalized in July 2024 by the FDIC and August 2024 by the FRB \nthat amended resolution planning requirements for certain foreign filers, including Deutsche Bank, and extended the \nresolution plan submission deadline to October 1 2025. Deutsche Bank intends to address the noted areas of improvement \nfrom the feedback letter and updated guidance as part of the U.S. Resolution Plan submission. \n"}

Treasury implements Deutsche Bank’s capital strategy, which itself is \ndeveloped by the Group Risk Committee and approved by the Management Board. Treasury, directly or through the Group \nAsset and Liability Committee, manages, among other things, issuance and repurchase of shares and capital instruments, \nhedging of capital ratios against foreign exchange swings, setting capacities for key financial resources, the design of \nshareholders’ equity allocation, and regional capital planning. The bank is fully committed to maintaining Deutsche Bank’s \nsound capitalization both from an economic and regulatory perspective considering both book equity based on IFRS \naccounting standards, regulatory and economic capital as well as specific capital requirements from rating agencies. The \nbank continuously monitors and adjusts Deutsche Bank’s overall capital demand and supply to always achieve an \nappropriate balance. \nTreasury manages the issuance and repurchase of capital instruments, namely Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 \nand Tier 2 capital instruments as well as TLAC/MREL eligible debt instruments. Treasury constantly monitors the market \nfor liability management trades. Such trades represent a countercyclical opportunity to create Common Equity Tier 1 \ncapital by buying back Deutsche Bank’s issuances below par. \nTreasury manages the sensitivity of Deutsche Bank’s CET 1 ratio and capital towards swings in foreign currency exchange \nrates against the euro. For this purpose, Treasury develops and executes suitable hedging strategies within the constraints \nof a Management Board approved Risk Appetite. Capital invested into Deutsche Bank’s foreign subsidiaries and branches \nis either not hedged, partially hedged or fully hedged. Thereby, Treasury aims to balance effects from foreign exchange \nrate movements on capital, capital deduction items and risk weighted assets in foreign currency. In addition, Treasury also \naccounts for associated hedge cost and implications on market risk weighted assets.  \nResource limit setting \nUsage of key financial resources is influenced through the following governance processes and incentives. \nTarget resource capacities are reviewed in Deutsche Bank’s annual strategic plan in line with Deutsche Bank’s CET 1 and \nLeverage Ratio ambitions. As a part of Deutsche Bank’s quarterly process, the Group Asset and Liability Committee \napproves divisional resource limits for total capital demand (defined as the sum of RWA and certain RWA equivalents of \nCapital Deduction Items and certain RWA equivalents of Capital Buffer Requirements items) and leverage exposure that \nare based on the strategic plan but adjusted for market conditions and the short-term outlook. Limits are enforced through \na close monitoring process and an excess charging mechanism. \nOverall regulatory capital requirements are principally driven by either Deutsche Bank’s CET 1 ratio (solvency) or leverage \nratio (leverage) requirements, whichever is the more binding constraint. For the internal capital allocation, the combined \ncontribution of each segment to the Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, the Group’s Leverage ratio and the Group’s \nCapital Loss under Stress are weighted to reflect their relative importance and level of constraint to the Group. \nContributions to the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and the Leverage ratio are measured through RWA and Leverage Ratio \nExposure (LRE). The Group’s Capital Loss under Stress is a measure of the Group’s overall economic risk exposure under a \ndefined stress scenario. Goodwill, other intangible assets, and business-related regulatory capital deduction items \nincluded in total capital demand are directly allocated to the respective segments, supporting the calculation of the \nallocated tangible shareholders equity and the respective rate of return.  \nMost of Deutsche Bank’s subsidiaries and several of Deutsche Bank’s branches are subject to legal and regulatory capital \nrequirements. In developing, implementing, and testing Deutsche Bank’s capital and liquidity position, the bank fully takes \nsuch legal and regulatory requirements into account. Any material capital requests of Deutsche Bank’s branches and \nsubsidiaries across the globe are presented to and approved by the Group Investment Committee prior to execution. \nFurther, Treasury is a member of Deutsche Bank’s Pensions Committee and represented in relevant Investment \nCommittees overseeing the management of the assets of the largest Deutsche Bank pension funds in Germany. These \ninvestment committees set the investment strategy for these funds in line with the bank’s investment objective to protect \nthe capital base and distribution capacity of the bank. \n"}

This assessment incorporates input from both first and second line of defense, with the identified risks assessed \nfor materiality based on their severity and likelihood of materialization. The assessment of risks is complemented by a view \non emerging risks applying a forward-looking perspective. This risk identification and assessment process results in the risk \ninventory which captures the material risks for the Group, and where relevant, across businesses, entities and branches.  \nRegular updates to the Group risk inventory are reported to the Enterprise Risk Committee for review and approval. The \ninventory is also discussed in the Group Risk Committee and reported to the Management Board. The inventory informs \nkey risk management processes, including the development of stress scenarios tailored to Deutsche Bank’s risk profile and \ninforming risk appetite setting and monitoring. Risks in the inventory are also mapped to risks in the Group risk type \ntaxonomy, where a corresponding materiality assessment is also provided. \nCredit Risk Management \nCredit risk framework \nCredit risk arises from all transactions where actual, contingent or potential claims against any counterparty, borrower, \nobligor or issuer (which Deutsche Bank refers to collectively as “counterparties”) exist, including those claims that \nDeutsche Bank plans to distribute. It captures the risk of loss because of a deterioration of a counterparty’s \ncreditworthiness or the failure of a counterparty to meet the terms of any contract with Deutsche Bank or otherwise \nperform as agreed.  \nBased on the Risk Type Taxonomy, credit risk is grouped into four material categories, namely default/migration risk, \ntransaction/settlement risk (exposure risk), mitigation risk and concentration risk. This is complemented by a regular risk \nidentification and materiality assessment. \n– Default/migration risk as the main element of credit risk, is the risk that a counterparty defaults on its payment \nobligations or experiences material credit quality deterioration increasing the likelihood of a default \n– Transaction/settlement risk is the risk that arises from any existing, contingent or potential future positive exposure \n– Mitigation risk is the risk of higher losses due to risk mitigation measures not performing as anticipated \n– Credit concentration risk is the risk of an adverse development in a specific single counterparty, country, industry or \nproduct leading to a disproportionate deterioration in the risk profile of Deutsche Bank’s credit exposures to that \ncounterparty, country, industry or product  \nDeutsche Bank manages its credit risk using the following philosophy and principles:  \n– Credit Risk is only accepted: \n– for adopted clients \n– after completed appropriate due diligence led by the respective origination teams as 1st LoD \n– New products and changes to existing products have to be assessed within DB Group’s new product approval (NPA) \nframework \n– If a rating has been assigned in line with agreed and approved processes \n– If all credit relevant exposures are correctly reflected in the relevant risk systems  \n– If plans for an orderly termination of the risk positions have been considered \n– Credit Risk is assumed within the applicable Risk Appetite  \n– P&L responsibility for credit exposures is owned by the originating Group Division \n– Risk taken needs to be adequately compensated \n– Risk must be continuously monitored and managed across 1st and 2nd LoD \n– Credit standards are applied consistently across all Group Divisions in order to maintain a favorable risk profile in line \nwith the Risk Appetite \n– Collateral or other risk mitigating, hedging or rating transfer instruments, which can be an alternative source of \nrepayment do not substitute for underwriting standards and a thorough assessment of the debt service ability of a \ncounterparty has to be performed during the credit process \n– Deutsche Bank strives to adequately secure, guarantee or hedge outright cash risk and longer tenor-exposures; this \napproach does usually not include lower risk short-term transactions and facilities supporting specific trade finance or \nother lower risk products where the margin allows for adequate loss coverage \n– Deutsche Bank measures and consolidates globally all exposure and facilities to the same Obligor.  \n"}

New loan requests (defined as increments, renewals/tenor extensions) above selected tenor and \nrating-based thresholds to corporate clients in high-carbon intensive sectors as well as those in sectors vulnerable to \nclimate-physical and nature (or “other environmental”) risks require dedicated climate risk assessment from the front office \nand review by Credit Risk Management. More information on additional controls and processes around the appetite and \nmanagement of environmental risks in the bank’s lending portfolio are reported in the following sections of this chapter. \nMeasuring Credit Risk  \nCredit risk is measured by credit rating, regulatory and internal capital demand and other key components like credit limits \nas mentioned below. \nThe credit rating is an essential part of the bank’s underwriting and credit process and provides – amongst others – a \ncornerstone for credit limit determination on an individual counterparty level, credit decision and transaction pricing as \nwell the determination of regulatory capital demand for credit risk. Each counterparty must be rated, and each rating has \nto be reviewed at least annually supported by ongoing monitoring of counterparties. A credit rating is a prerequisite for \nany credit limit established/approved. For each credit rating, the appropriate rating approach has to be applied and the \nderived credit rating has to be established in the relevant systems. Specific rating approaches have been established to \nbest reflect the respective characteristics of exposure classes, including specific product types, central governments and \ncentral banks, institutions, corporates and retail. \nCounterparties in the bank’s non-retail portfolios are rated by Deutsche Bank’s independent Credit Risk Management \nfunction partly using automated or semi-automated rating systems. Given the largely homogeneous nature of the retail \nportfolio, counterparty creditworthiness and ratings are predominately derived by utilizing an automated decision engine. \nCountry risk-related ratings are provided by Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Risk Research.  \nDeutsche Bank’s rating analysis is based on a combination of qualitative (including environmental) and quantitative factors. \nWhen rating a counterparty Deutsche Bank applies in-house assessment methodologies and, scorecards, as well as its 21-\ngrade rating scale.  \nChanges to existing credit models and introduction of new models are approved by the Regulatory Credit Risk Model \nCommittee (RCRMC) chaired by the Head of Credit Risk Management before the models are used for credit decisions and \ncapital calculation for the first time or before they are significantly changed. Separately, for all model changes and for new \nmodels an approval by Model Risk Management is required. Proposals with high impact are recommended for approval to \nthe Group Risk Committee. Furthermore, regulatory approval may also be required. The model validation is performed \nindependently of model development by Model Risk Management. The results of the regular validation processes as \nstipulated by internal policies are brought to the attention of the RCRMC, even if the validation results do not lead to a \nchange.  \nDeutsche Bank measures risk-weighted assets to determine the regulatory capital demand for credit risk using “advanced”, \n“foundation” and “standard” approaches of which “advanced” and “foundation” approaches are approved by the bank’s \nregulator.  \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 109, "text": " \n \n77  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisk and Capital Management \nAnnual Report 2024 \nCredit Risk Management \nThe advanced Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRBA) is the most sophisticated approach available under the regulatory \nframework for credit risk and allows Deutsche Bank to make use of its internal credit rating models as well as internal \nestimates of specific further risk parameters. These methods and parameters represent long-used key components of the \ninternal risk measurement and management process supporting the credit approval process, the economic capital and \nexpected loss calculation and the internal monitoring and reporting of credit risk. The relevant parameters include the \nprobability of default (PD), the loss given default (LGD) and the maturity (M) driving the regulatory risk-weight and the \ncredit conversion factor (CCF) as part of the regulatory exposure at default (EAD) estimation. For the majority of derivative \ncounterparty exposures as well as securities financing transactions (SFT), Deutsche Bank makes use of the internal model \nmethod (IMM) in accordance with CRR to calculate EAD. For most of the bank’s internal rating systems more than seven \nyears of historical information is available to assess these parameters. Deutsche Bank’s internal rating methodologies aim \nat point-in-time rather than a through-the-cycle rating, but in line with regulatory solvency requirements, they are \ncalibrated based on long-term averages of observed default rates. \nThe foundation IRBA is an approach available under the regulatory framework for credit risk allowing institutions to make \nuse of their internal rating methodologies while using pre-defined regulatory values for all other risk parameters. \nParameters subject to internal estimates include the PD while the LGD and the CCF are defined in the regulatory \nframework. Foundation IRBA remains in place for some exposures stemming from ex-Postbank. \nDeutsche Bank applies the standardized approach to a subset of its credit risk exposures. The standardized approach \nmeasures credit risk either pursuant to fixed risk weights, which are predefined by the regulator, or through the application \nof external ratings. Deutsche Bank assigns certain credit exposures permanently to the standardized approach in \naccordance with Article 150 CRR. These are predominantly exposures to the Federal Republic of Germany and other \nGerman public sector entities as well as exposures to central governments of other European Member States that meet \nthe required conditions. These exposures make up the majority of the exposures carried in the standardized approach and \nreceive predominantly a risk weight of zero percent. For internal purposes, however, these exposures are subject to an \ninternal credit assessment and fully integrated in the risk management and economic capital processes.  \nIn addition to the above-described regulatory capital demand, Deutsche Bank determines the internal capital demand for \ncredit risk via an economic capital model. \nDeutsche Bank calculates economic capital for the default risk, country risk and settlement risk as elements of credit risk. \nIn line with the bank’s economic capital framework, economic capital for credit risk is set at a level to absorb with a \nprobability of 99.9% very severe aggregate unexpected losses within one year. Deutsche Bank’s economic capital for credit \nrisk is derived from the loss distribution of a portfolio via Monte Carlo Simulation of correlated rating migrations. The loss \ndistribution is modeled in two steps. First, individual credit exposures are specified based on parameters for the probability \nof default, exposure at default and loss given default. In a second step, the probability of joint defaults is modeled through \nthe introduction of economic factors, which correspond to geographic regions and industries. The simulation of portfolio \nlosses is then performed by an internally developed model, which takes rating migration and maturity effects into account \nas well as LGD volatility. Effects due to wrong-way derivatives risk (i.e., the credit exposure of a derivative in the default \ncase is higher than in non-default scenarios) are modeled by applying the bank’s own alpha factor when deriving the \nexposure at default for derivatives and securities financing transactions under the CRR. Deutsche Bank allocates expected \nlosses and economic capital derived from loss distributions down to transaction level to enable management on \ntransaction, customer and business level. \nBesides the credit rating, as a key component for managing the bank’s credit portfolio, including individual transaction \napproval and the setting of risk appetite, Deutsche Bank establishes credit limits for all credit exposures. Credit limits set \nforth maximum credit exposures Deutsche Bank is willing to assume over specified periods. In determining the credit limit \nfor a counterparty, Deutsche Bank considers the counterparty’s credit quality above others by reference to its internal \ncredit rating. Credit limits and credit exposures are both measured on a gross and net basis where net is derived by \ndeducting appropriate hedges and certain collateral from respective gross figures. For derivatives, Deutsche Bank looks at \ncurrent market values and the potential future exposure over the relevant time horizon, which is based upon the bank’s \nlegal agreements with the counterparty. \n \n \n"}

This chapter also highlights uncertainties \nnoted in 2024 and at year end, along with the impact from reasonable changes in the Group’s key model assumptions.  \nThese credit risk management activities and assessments are embedded in the bank’s overall control and governance \nframework for credit risk which includes the estimation of expected credit losses under IFRS 9 and the governance around \nthe models used. These activities include, but are not limited to, regular emerging and novel risk reviews as well as portfolio \ndeep dives, day to day risk management on the level of individual borrowers, as well as regular model validations. Further \nexplanations are provided regarding management overlays applied to the credit loss allowance, how reviews of relevant \nassumptions and inputs to the ECL calculation are performed and how, as part of the model reviews, potential model \nimprecision and whether any overlays were necessary, are assessed. The Group also presents background on management \noverlays recorded at the end of 2023, throughout 2024 and at the end of 2024. To provide additional transparency on the \nimpact of reasonable changes to the key assumptions, model sensitivities are presented in a separate section which \nconcludes with the key drivers for the IFRS 9 model results. \nDescription of IFRS 9 model and methodology \nThe impairment requirements of IFRS 9 apply to all credit exposures that are measured at amortized cost or fair value \nthrough other comprehensive income and to off balance sheet lending commitments, such as loan commitments and \nfinancial guarantees. For purposes of the bank’s impairment approach, the Group refers to these instruments as financial \nassets. \nThe Group determines its allowance for credit losses in accordance with IFRS 9 as follows: \n– Stage 1 reflects financial assets where it is assumed that credit risk has not increased significantly after initial \nrecognition  \n– Stage 2 contains all financial assets, that are not defaulted, but have experienced a significant increase in credit risk \nsince initial recognition \n– Stage 3 consists of financial assets which deemed to be in default in accordance with Deutsche Bank’s policies, which \nare based on the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) Article 178. The Group defines these financial assets as \nimpaired, non-performing and defaulted \n– Significant increase in credit risk is determined using quantitative and qualitative information based on the Group’s \nhistorical experience, credit risk assessment and forward-looking information \n– Purchased or Originated Credit-Impaired (POCI) financial assets are assets where at the time of initial recognition, there \nis objective evidence of impairment and the Group purchased at a discount. \nThe IFRS 9 impairment approach is an integral part of the Group’s credit risk management procedures. The estimation of \nECL is either performed via the automated, parameter based ECL calculation using the Group’s ECL model or determined \nby credit officers. In both cases, the calculation takes place for each financial asset individually. Similarly, the \ndetermination of the need to transfer between stages is made on an individual asset basis. The Group’s ECL model is used \nto calculate the allowance for credit losses for all financial assets in Stage 1 and Stage 2, as well as for Stage 3 in the \nhomogeneous portfolio (i.e., retail and small business loans with similar credit risk characteristics). For financial assets in \nthe bank’s non-homogeneous portfolio in Stage 3 and for POCI assets, the allowance for credit losses is determined \nindividually by credit officers. \nThe Group uses three main components to measure ECL. These are Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) \nand Exposure at Default (EAD). The Group leverages existing parameters used for determination of capital demand under \nthe Basel Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRBA) and internal risk management practices as much as possible to calculate \nECL. These parameters are adjusted where necessary to comply with IFRS 9 requirements (e.g., use of point in time ratings \nand removal of downturn add-ons in the regulatory parameters). Incorporating forecasts of future economic variables into \nthe measurement of ECL influences the allowance for credit losses. In order to calculate lifetime ECL, the Group’s \ncalculation derives the corresponding lifetime PDs from migration matrices that reflect economic forecasts. \nIn 2023, the Group completed three migration waves of the Postbank clients into the IT systems of Deutsche Bank, which \nresulted in the Group-wide alignment of the IFRS 9 impairment model and methodologies, while specific models previously \napplied for the Postbank were to a large extent decommissioned. The final wave of the IT migration took place in the third \nquarter of 2024 and included the BHW mortgage and Postbank factoring portfolios. The migration led to an immaterial \nECL increase. \n"}

If there is a significant \nincrease in credit risk, the financial asset is transferred to Stage 2. A significant increase in credit risk is determined by using \nrating-related and process-related indicators. The transfer of financial assets to Stage 3 is based on the status of the \nborrower being in default. If a borrower is in default, all financial assets of the borrower are transferred to Stage 3.  \nRating-related Stage 2 indicators: The Group compares a borrower’s lifetime PD at the reporting date with lifetime PD \nexpectations at the date of initial recognition to determine if there has been a significant change in the borrower’s PDs and \nconsequently to any of the borrower’s transaction in the scope of IFRS 9 impairment. Based on historically observed \nmigration behavior and a sampling of different economic scenarios, a lifetime PD distribution is obtained. A quantile of this \ndistribution, which is defined for each counterparty class, is chosen as the lifetime PD threshold. If the remaining lifetime \nPD of a transaction according to current expectations exceeds this threshold, the financial asset is deemed to have \nincurred a significant increase in credit risk and is transferred to Stage 2. The quantiles used to define Stage 2 thresholds \nare determined using expert judgment, are reviewed annually and have not changed since implementation of IFRS 9. The \nthresholds applied vary depending on the original credit quality of the borrower, elapsed lifetime, remaining lifetime and \ncounterparty class. Management believes that the defined approach and quantiles represent a meaningful indicator that \na financial asset has incurred a significant increase in credit risk. In 2024 the Group started a review of the appropriateness \nof the quantile approach, which is still ongoing. An alternative approach has been developed and is currently being tested. \nInitial preliminary impacts appear to be neutral. As an interim step Deutsche Bank decided to introduce the threefold PD \nincrease as additional Stage 2 trigger as a backstop, which went live in August 2024 and only lead to an immaterial impact \non ECL.  \nProcess-related Stage 2 indicators are derived via the use of existing risk management indicators, which in the bank’s view \nrepresent situations where the credit risk of financial assets has significantly increased. These include borrowers being \nadded to the Group’s watchlist, being transferred to workout status, payments being 30 days or more past due or being in \nforbearance. As long as the condition for one or more of the process-related or rating-related indicators is fulfilled and the \nborrower of the financial asset has not met the definition of default, the asset will remain in Stage 2. If the Stage 2 \nindicators are no longer fulfilled and the financial asset has not defaulted, the financial asset transfers back to Stage 1. In \ncase of performing forborne financial assets, the probation period is two years before the financial asset is reclassified to \nStage 1, which is aligned with regulatory guidance.  \nIf the borrower defaults, all transactions of the borrower are allocated to Stage 3. If, at a later date, the borrower is no \nlonger in default, the curing criteria according to regulatory guidance is applied (including probation periods), which are at \nleast three months or one year in case of distressed restructurings. Once the regulatory cure period or criteria has been \nmet, the borrower will cease to be classified as defaulted and will be transferred back to Stage 2 or Stage 1. \nThe ECL calculation for Stage 3 distinguishes between transactions in the homogeneous and non-homogenous portfolios, \nas well as POCI financial assets. For transactions that are in Stage 3 and in a homogeneous portfolio, the Group uses a \nparameter-based automated approach to determine the credit loss allowance per transaction. For these transactions, the \nLGD parameters are to a large extent modelled to be time-dependent, i.e., consider the declining recovery expectation as \ntime elapses after default. The allowance for credit losses for financial assets in the bank’s non-homogeneous portfolios \nin Stage 3, as well as for POCI assets are determined by credit officers and have to be approved along an established \nauthority grid up to and including the Management Board. This allows credit officers to consider currently available \ninformation and recovery expectations specific to the borrowers and the financial assets at the reporting date.  \nEstimation techniques for key input factors \nThe first key input factor in the Group ECL calculation is the one-year PD for borrowers which is derived from the bank’s \ninternal rating systems. The Group assigns a PD to each borrower credit exposure based on a 21-grade master rating scale \nfor all of the Group’s exposure.  \nThe borrower ratings assigned are derived based on internally developed rating models which specify consistent and \ndistinct customer-relevant criteria and assign a rating grade based on a specific set of criteria as given for a certain \ncustomer. The set of criteria is generated from information sets relevant for the respective customer segments including \ngeneral customer behavior, financial and external data (e.g., credit bureau). The methods in use range from statistical \nscoring models to expert-based models taking into account the relevant available quantitative and qualitative information. \nExpert-based models are usually applied for borrowers in the exposure classes “Central governments and central banks”, \n“Institutions” and “Corporates” with the exception of those “Corporates” for which a sufficient data basis is available for \nstatistical scoring models. For the latter, as well as for the retail segment, statistical scoring or hybrid models combining \nboth approaches are commonly used. Quantitative rating methodologies are developed based on applicable statistical \nmodelling techniques, such as logistic regression. \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 112, "text": " \n \n80  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisk and Capital Management \nAnnual Report 2024 \nCredit Risk Management \nOne-year PDs are extended to multi-year PD curves using through-the-cycle matrices and macroeconomic forecasts. \nBased on economic scenarios centered around the macroeconomic baseline forecast, through-the-cycle matrices are first \ntransformed into point-in-time rating migration matrices, typically for a two-year period. The calculation of the point-in-\ntime matrices provides the link between macroeconomic variables and the default and rating behavior of borrowers, which \nis derived from time series through regression techniques involving macroeconomic variables (MEVs) and historical rating \nand default data. In a final step, multi-year PD curves are derived from point-in-time rating migration matrices for periods \nwhere reasonable and supportable forecasts are available and extrapolated based on through-the-cycle rating migration \nmatrices beyond those periods. \nThe second key input factor into the ECL calculation is the LGD parameter, which is defined as the likely loss intensity in \ncase of a borrower’s default. It provides an estimation of the exposure that cannot be recovered in a default event and \ntherefore captures the severity of a loss. Conceptually, LGD estimates are independent of a borrower’s probability of \ndefault. The LGD models applied in Stages 1 and 2, which are based on regulatory LGD models, but adjusted for IFRS 9 \nrequirements (i.e., removal of downturn-add-on and removal of indirect costs of workout), ensure that the main drivers for \nlosses (i.e., different levels and quality of collateralization and customer or product types or seniority of facility) are \nreflected as risk drivers in LGD estimates. In the bank’s LGD models, the Group assigns collateral type specific LGD \nparameters to the collateralized exposure (collateral value after application of haircuts).  \nForward-looking information (FLI) is also incorporated into LGD projections in terms of FLI LGD scaling factors for \nexposures in Stages 1 and 2 based on forecasts for key MEVs. LGD adjustments are quantified relative to long-term \nhistorical averages, which represent a neutral reference point throughout an economic cycle.  \nThe LGD setting for defaulted homogeneous portfolios are partially dependent on time after default and are either \ncalibrated based on the Group’s multi-decade loss and recovery experience using statistical methods or for less significant \nportfolios certain LGD model input parameters (e.g., cure rates) are determined by expert judgement.  \nThe third key input factor is the exposure at default over the lifetime of a financial asset which is modelled taking into \naccount expected repayment profiles (e.g., linear amortization, annuities, bullet loan structures). Prepayment options are \nmodelled for some portfolios. The bank applies specific credit conversion factors (CCFs) in order to calculate an EAD value. \nConceptually, the EAD is defined as the expected amount of the credit exposure to a borrower at the time of its default. \nIn instances where a transaction involves an unused limit, a percentage share of this unused limit is added to the \noutstanding amount in order to appropriately reflect the expected outstanding amount in case of a borrower’s default. \nThis reflects the assumption that for commitments, the utilization at the time of default might be higher than the current \noutstanding balance. In case a transaction involves an additional contingent component (i.e., guarantees) a further \npercentage share is applied as part of the CCF model in order to estimate the amount of guarantees drawn in case of \ndefault. The calibrations of such parameters are based on internal historical data and are either based on empirical analysis \nor supported by expert judgement and consider borrower and product type specifics. Where supervisory CCF values need \nto be applied for regulatory purposes, internal estimates are used for IFRS 9. \nExpected lifetime  \nIFRS 9 requires the determination of lifetime ECL for which the expected lifetime of a financial asset is a key input factor. \nLifetime ECL represent default events over the expected life of a financial asset. The Group measures ECL considering the \nrisk of default over the maximum contractual period (including any borrower’s extension options) over which the Group is \nexposed to credit risk.  \nRetail overdrafts, credit card facilities and certain corporate revolving facilities typically include both a loan and an \nundrawn commitment component. The expected lifetime of such on-demand facilities exceeds their contractual life as \nthey are typically cancelled only when the Group becomes aware of an increase in credit risk. The expected lifetime is \nestimated by taking into consideration historical information and the Group’s credit risk management actions such as credit \nlimit reductions and facility cancellation. Where such facilities are subject to an individual review by credit risk \nmanagement, the lifetime for calculating ECL is 12 months. For facilities not subject to individual review by credit risk \nmanagement, the bank applies a lifetime for calculating ECL of 24 months. \nInterest rate used in the IFRS 9 model \nIn the context of the ECL calculation, the Group applies in line with IFRS 9 an approximation of the effective interest rate \n(EIR), which is usually the contractual interest rate. The contractual interest rate is deemed to be an appropriate \napproximation, as the interest rate is consistently used in the ECL model, interest recognition and for discounting of the \nECL and does not materially differ from the EIR. \n \n \n"}

At the reporting \ndate, the model uses the existing collateral distribution process applied in Deutsche Bank’s economic capital model. In this \nmodel, the liquidation value of each eligible collateral is allocated to relevant financial assets to distinguish between \ncollateralized and uncollateralized parts of each financial asset. In the ECL calculation, the Group subsequently applies \nthe aforementioned LGDs for secured and unsecured exposures to derive the ECL for the secured and unsecured part of \nthe exposure separately. \nFor personal collateral (e.g., guarantees), the ECL model assumes that the relative level of collateralization remains stable \nover time. In the case of an amortizing loan, the outstanding exposure and collateral values decrease together over time. \nFor physical collateral (e.g., real estate property), the ECL shall assume that the absolute collateral value remains constant. \nIn case of an amortizing loan, the collateralized part of the exposure increases over time and the loan-to-value decreases \naccordingly. \nCertain financial guarantee contracts are integral to the financial assets guaranteed. In such cases, the financial guarantee \nis considered as collateral for the financial asset and the benefit of the guarantee is used to mitigate the ECL of the \nguaranteed financial asset. \nForward looking information \nUnder IFRS 9, the allowance for credit losses is based on reasonable and supportable forward-looking information available \nwithout undue cost or effort, which takes into consideration past events, current conditions and forecasts of future \neconomic conditions.  \nTo incorporate forward looking information into the Group’s allowance for credit losses, the bank uses two key elements: \n– As its base scenario, the Group uses external survey-based macroeconomic forecasts (e.g., consensus views on GDP and \nunemployment rates); in addition, the scenario expansion model, which has been initially developed for stress testing, \nis used for forecasting macroeconomic variables that are not covered by external consensus data; all forecasts are \nassumed to reflect the most likely development of the respective variables; the Group regularly updates its forecasts \nfor macro-economic factors during the quarter and reviews aspects of potential model imprecision (e.g., MEV \nparameters outside the historic range used for model calibration, if not already included in the model) as part of an MEV \nmonitoring framework to assess if an overlay is required \n– Statistical techniques are then applied to transform the base scenario projections into a probability distribution of the \nmacroeconomic variables; these scenarios specify deviations from the baseline forecasts; the scenario distribution is \nthen used for deriving multi-year PD curves for different rating and counterparty classes, which are applied in the ECL \ncalculation and in the identification of significant deterioration in credit quality of financial assets as described above \nin the rating-related Stage 2 indicators \nThe Group's Risk and Finance Credit Loss Provision Forum monitors the impact of forward-looking information, including \nthe latest macroeconomic variables, on a quarterly basis and determines if any additional overlays are required. Although \ninterest rates and inflation are not separately included in the MEVs, the economic impact of these risks is reflected in GDP \ngrowth rates, unemployment, equities and credit spreads as higher rates and inflation filter through these forecasts. As of \nDecember 31, 2024, the consensus data applied in the ECL model was deemed to have reflected the latest \nmacroeconomic developments and after considering all relevant uncertainties in the MEVs no additional overlays were \nrequired.  \nAs described earlier, the Group’s approach to reflect forward-looking information into the calculation of ECL is to \nincorporate forecasts for the next two to three years into PD and LGD projections. For periods beyond those covered in \nterms of reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, reversion to historically observed behavior of defaults, rating \nmigrations and recoveries is used for ECL measurement.  \nThe tables below contain relevant forward-looking information by macroeconomic variable included in the Group’s IFRS \n9 model as of December 31, 2024, and as of December 31, 2023. \n"}

Below the bank provides \nsensitivity analysis on the potential impact if these key assumptions applied in the ECL model were to deviate from the \nbank’s base case expectations. \nMacroeconomic variables \nThe sensitivity of the ECL model with respect to potential changes in projections for key MEVs is shown in the tables below, \nwhich provides ECL impacts for Stages 1 and 2 from downward and upward shifts applied separately to each group of MEV \nas of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023.

If for all Stage 1 borrowers Deutsche \nBank were to record lifetime expected credit losses, the Group’s allowance for credit losses amounting to € 6.2 billion as \nof December 31, 2024 and € 5.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 would increase by approximately 34% as of year end 2024 \nand 38% as of 2023, respectively. \nStage 3 LGD setting \nThe Group’s allowance for credit losses in Stage 3 for the homogeneous portfolios amounts to € 3.0 billion as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and € 2.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. The key driver in determining the ECL provision is the loss \ngiven default estimate, which differs by individual portfolios. Loss given default is influenced by recovery rates, proceeds \nfrom the sale of collateral, and cure rates. Some of the drivers for different portfolios include elements of expert judgment \nand in particular on expected cure rates. If the LGD for all homogeneous portfolios were to increase by 1%, then Stage 3 \nECL would increase as of December 31, 2024 by approximately € 26 million (thereof € 17 million in Germany, € 5 million in \nItaly and € 2 million in Spain), and by approximately € 22 million as of December 31, 2023 (thereof € 14 million in Germany, \n€ 5 million in Italy and € 2 million in Spain). \nManagement overlays applied to the IFRS 9 model output \nThe Group regularly reviews the IFRS 9 methodology and processes, key inputs into the ECL calculation and discusses \nupcoming model changes, potential model imprecisions or other estimation uncertainties, for example in the \nmacroeconomic environment to determine if any material overlays are required. Moreover, regular reviews for evolving or \nemerging risks are performed, especially in the current geopolitical environment. Measures applied include client surveys \nand interviews, along with analysis of portfolios across businesses, regions and sectors. In addition, the Group regularly \nreviews and validates key model inputs and assumptions (including those in feeder models) and ensures where expert \njudgement is applied, it is in line with the Group’s risk management framework. As of December 31, 2024, the Group did \nnot identify any model weaknesses that would require an additional overlay, except for the ECL model related changes, \nfor which overlays have been recorded. \nAs of year end 2024, the Group’s IFRS9 management overlays amounted to € 124 million, compared to € 84 million for \nyear end 2023 (which resulted in an increase of Allowance for Credit Losses in both periods). In the second quarter 2024, \nthe Group reduced it‘s management overlay relating to FLI following the deployment of the related model refinement \nwhich led to the expected ECL increase. Further, the Group introduced two new overlays following a review of model \nperformance to bring forward the expected impacts from a model refinement related to refinancing risk, which is the main \ncontributor of the total overlay amount, represents a change in estimate and is envisaged for future technical \nimplementation, as well as from a PD parameter recalibration envisaged for the first half of 2025. \nOverall Assessment of ECL’s \nTo ensure that Deutsche Bank’s ECL model accounted for the uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment \nthroughout 2024, the Group continued to review emerging risks, assessed potential baseline and downside impacts and \nrequired actions to manage the bank’s credit strategy and risk appetite. The outcome of these reviews concluded that the \nbank adequately provisioned for its expected credit losses as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023.  \nResults from the above reviews and development of key portfolio indicators are regularly discussed at the Credit Risk \nAppetite and Management Forum and Group Risk Committee. Where necessary, actions and measures are taken to \nmitigate the risks. Client ratings are regularly reviewed to reflect the latest macroeconomic developments and where \npotentially significant risks are identified clients are moved to the watchlist (Stage 2), forbearance measures may be \nnegotiated, and credit limits and collateralization are reviewed. Overall, the Group believes that based on its day-to-day \nrisk management activities and regular reviews of emerging risks it has adequately provided for its ECL. \n"}

The increase was driven by cyclical events in the \nCommercial Real Estate sector, certain larger corporate credit events and temporary effects following the Postbank \nintegration. The wider portfolios performed broadly in line with expectations despite the challenging macroeconomic and \ninterest rate environment.  \nWith regard to climate risks, estimates of higher transition and physical risk exposures and their impact on the Expected \nCredit Loss (ECL) did not result in any adjustment of credit loss provisions for the years ended December 31, 2024 as well \nand December 31, 2023. \nFor details of the provision for credit losses related to the segments, please refer to section Segment results of operations. \nFor details on the Group’s accounting policy related to IFRS 9 Impairment, please refer to Note 1 - Material accounting \npolicies and critical accounting estimates of the consolidated financial statements.  \nManaging and mitigation of credit risk \nManaging credit risk on counterparty level  \nCredit-relevant counterparties are principally allocated to credit officers within credit teams which are organized by type \nof counterparty (such as financial institutions, corporates or private individuals), economic area (e.g., emerging markets) or \nproduct and supported by dedicated rating analyst teams where deemed necessary. The individual credit officers have the \nrelevant expertise and experience to manage the credit risks associated with these counterparties and their associated \ncredit related transactions. For retail clients, credit decision making and credit monitoring is highly automated due to \nstandardized products and processes. Credit Risk Management has full oversight of the respective processes and tools \nused in these highly automated retail credit processes. It is the responsibility of each credit officer to undertake ongoing \ncredit monitoring for their allocated counterparties. Deutsche Bank also has procedures in place intended to identify at an \nearly-stage credit exposures for which there may be an increased risk of deteriorated risk/loss. \nIn instances where Deutsche Bank has identified counterparties with emerging concern about their credit quality \ndeteriorating or likely to deteriorate to the point where they present a heightened risk of default/loss, the respective \ncounterparty is generally placed on the “Watchlist”. Deutsche Bank aims to identify those counterparties at an early stage \nto ensure that credit exposures with increased risks are effectively managed, the Bank’s risk management tools are \nappropriately applied aiming to minimize potential losses. The objective of this early warning system is to address potential \nproblems while adequate options for action are still available. This early risk detection is a tenet of Deutsche Bank’s credit \nculture and is designed to raise management awareness of these positions. Environmental risks are now considered as \npotential triggers for discretionary inclusion in watchlist for groups or counterparties facing climate and environmental \nrelated risks without adequate risk mitigation strategy in place. \nCredit limits for individual counterparties are established by the Credit Risk Management function applying credit \nauthorities assigned to individual Credit Officers. This also applies to settlement risk that must fall within limits pre-\napproved by Credit Risk Management and in a manner that reflects expected settlement patterns for the subject \ncounterparty. Credit approvals are documented by electronic signature under 4-eye principle by the respective credit \nauthority holders and are retained for future reference. \nCredit authority is generally assigned as a personal credit authority according to the individual’s professional qualification \nand experience. All assigned credit authorities are reviewed on a periodic basis to help ensure that they are commensurate \nwith the individual performance of the authority holder.  \nWhere credit authority is insufficient to establish required credit limits, the transaction is referred to a credit authority \nholder with the respective credit authority or if exceeding the highest personal authority to an appropriate credit \ncommittee. Where personal and committee authorities are insufficient to establish appropriate limits, the case is referred \nto the Management Board for approval. \n \n \n"}

These techniques are applied in the \nfollowing forms: \n– Comprehensive and enforceable credit documentation with adequate terms and conditions \n– Collateral in its various forms to reduce losses by increasing the recovery of obligations; key principles for collateral \nmanagement include legal effectiveness and enforceability, prudent and realistic collateral valuations, risk and \nregulatory capital reduction, as well as cost efficiency  \n– Risk transfers, which shift the risk of default of an obligor to a third-party including hedging executed by the bank’s \nStrategic Corporate Lending (SCL) team or entity; other de-risking tools, such as securitizations etc., may also be \nemployed \n– Netting and collateral arrangements which reduce the credit exposure from derivatives and securities financing \ntransactions (e.g. repo transactions) \n– Hedging of derivatives counterparty risk including CVA, using primarily CDS contracts via the bank’s Counterparty \nPortfolio Management desk \nCollateral \nDeutsche Bank regularly agrees on collateral to be received from customers that are subject to credit risk or to be provided \nby third parties agreed by legally effective and enforceable contracts as documented by a written and reasoned legal \nopinion. Collateral is credit protection in the form of (funded) assigned or pledged assets or (unfunded) third-party \nobligations that serves to mitigate the inherent risk of credit loss in an exposure, by either substituting the counterparty \ndefault risk or improving recoveries in the event of a default. Deutsche Bank generally takes all types of eligible collateral \nfor its respective businesses but may limit accepted collateral types for specific businesses or regions as customary in the \nrespective market or driven by purpose of efficiency. While collateral can be an alternative source of repayment, it does \nnot replace the necessity of high-quality underwriting standards and a thorough assessment of the debt service ability of \nthe counterparty in line with Article 194 (9) CRR. \nDeutsche Bank distinguishes the following two types of credit protection approaches:  \n– Funded Credit Protection like financial and other collateral, which enables Deutsche Bank to recover all or part of the \noutstanding exposure by liquidating the collateral/asset provided, in cases where the counterparty is unable or \nunwilling to fulfill its primary obligations. Cash collateral, securities (equity, bonds), collateral pledges or assignments \nof other claims or inventory, movable assets (i.e., plant, machinery, ships and aircraft) and real estate typically fall into \nthis category; all financial collateral is regularly, mostly daily, revalued and measured against the respective credit \nexposure; the value of other collateral, including real estate, is monitored based upon established processes that \nincludes regular reviews or revaluations by internal and/or external experts \n– Unfunded Credit Protection like Guarantees, which complement the counterparty’s ability to fulfill its obligation under \nthe legal contract and as such is provided by uncorrelated third parties. Letters of credit, insurance contracts, export \ncredit insurance, guarantees, credit derivatives and (unfunded) risk participations typically fall into this category. \nGuarantees and strong letters of comfort provided by correlated group members of customers (generally the parent \ncompany) may also be accepted and considered in approved rating approaches; guarantee collateral with a non-\ninvestment grade rating of the guarantor is limited \nDeutsche Bank’s processes seek to ensure that the collateral accepted for risk mitigation purposes is of high quality. This \nincludes processes to generally ensure legally effective and enforceable documentation for realizable and measurable \ncollateral or assets which are evaluated within the on-boarding process by dedicated internal appraisers or teams with the \nrespective qualification, skills and experience or adequate external valuers mandated in regulated processes. The applied \nvaluations follow generally accepted valuation methods or models and include the identification of material climate \nphysical and transition risks. Ongoing correctness of values is monitored by collateral type-specific, appropriately \nfrequent, and event-driven reviews considering relevant risk parameters. Revaluations are applied in cases of identified \nprobable material deterioration and future monitoring may be adjusted respectively. The assessment of the suitability of \ncollateral for a specific transaction is part of the credit decision and must be undertaken in a conservative way, including \ncollateral haircuts that are applied. Deutsche Bank has collateral type specific haircuts in place which are regularly \nreviewed and approved. In this regard, Deutsche Bank strives to avoid “wrong-way” risk characteristics where the \ncounterparty’s risk is positively correlated with the risk of deterioration in the collateral value. If collateral with material \ncorrelation risk is accepted anyhow, a potential impact on its value is considered conservatively in the valuation. For \nunfunded credit protection like guarantees, the process for the analysis of the guarantor’s creditworthiness is aligned to \nthe credit assessment process for credit-relevant counterparties. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 120, "text": " \n \n88  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisk and Capital Management \nAnnual Report 2024 \nCredit Risk Management \nThe valuation of collateral is considered under a liquidation scenario. The liquidation value is equal to the expected \nproceeds of collateral monetization/realization in a base case scenario, wherein a fair price is achieved through careful \npreparation and orderly liquidation of the collateral. Collateral can either move in value over time (dynamic value) or not \n(static value). The dynamic liquidation value generally includes a safety margin or haircut over realizable value to address \nliquidity and marketability aspects. \nThe Deutsche Bank Group assigns a liquidation value to eligible collateral, based on, among other things: \n– The market value and/or lending value, notional amount or face value of a collateral as a starting point  \n– The type of collateral; the currency mismatch, if any, between the secured exposure and the collateral; and a maturity \nmismatch, if any \n– The applicable legal environment or jurisdiction (onshore versus offshore collateral) \n– The market liquidity and volatility in relation to agreed termination clauses \n– The correlation between the performance of the borrower and the value of the collateral, e.g., in the case of the pledge \nof a borrower’s own shares or securities (in this case generally full correlation leads to no liquidation value) \n– The quality of physical collateral and potential for litigation or environmental risks; and \n– A determined collateral type specific haircut (0 – 100%) reflecting collection risks (i.e. price risks over the average \nliquidation period and processing/utilization/sales costs) as specified in the respective documents \nCollateral haircut settings are typically based on available historic internal and/or external recovery data (expert opinions \nmay also be used, where appropriate). They also incorporate a forward-looking component in the form of collection and \nvaluation forecast provided by experts within Risk Management. Considering the expected proceeds from the liquidation \nof the different collateral types, respective value fluctuations, market specific liquidation costs, and time applied haircuts \nvary between 0 to 100%. When data is not sufficiently available or inconclusive, more conservative haircuts than otherwise \nused must be applied. Haircut settings are reviewed at least annually. Historically validated proceeds from collateral \nliquidation are also implied respectively in current Loss-Given-Default calculations where market values of collateral \ninstead of liquidation values are applied. \nRisk transfers \nRisk transfers to third parties form a key part of the bank’s overall risk management process and are executed in various \nforms, including outright sales, single name and portfolio hedging, and securitizations (significant risk transfers). Risk \ntransfers are conducted by the respective business units and/or by Strategic Corporate Lending, in accordance with \nspecifically approved mandates. \nStrategic Corporate Lending manages the residual credit risk of loans and lending-related commitments of the \ninstitutional and corporate credit portfolio, part of the leveraged lending portfolio and the medium-sized German \ncompanies’ portfolio across the bank’s Corporate Bank and Investment Bank divisions.  \nActing as a central pricing reference, Strategic Corporate Lending provides the businesses with an observed or derived \ncapital market rate for loan applications; however, the decision of whether or not the business can enter into the credit risk \nremains exclusively with Credit Risk Management. \nStrategic Corporate Lending concentrates on two primary objectives within the credit risk framework to enhance risk \nmanagement discipline, improve returns and use capital more efficiently:  \n– To reduce single-name credit risk concentrations within the credit portfolio and \n– To manage credit exposures by utilizing techniques including loan sales, securitization (significant risk transfer) via \ncollateralized loan obligations, sub-participations and single-name and portfolio credit default swaps  \nNetting and collateral arrangements for derivatives and securities financing transactions \nNetting is applicable to both exchange traded derivatives and OTC derivatives (whether cleared or uncleared). Netting is \nalso applied to securities financing transactions (e.g. repurchase, securities lending and margin lending transactions) as far \nas documentation, structure and nature of the risk mitigation allow netting with the underlying credit risk in accordance \nwith applicable law and the bank’s Financial Contracts Netting and Collateral KOD – Legal ( “Netting Policy”). While cross-\nproduct netting between derivatives and securities financing transactions may be used in certain cases, the bank does not \nmake use of cross-product netting for regulatory purposes.  \nAll exchange traded derivatives are cleared through Central Counterparties (CCPs) , which interpose themselves between \nthe trading entities by becoming the counterparty to each of the entities. Where legally required or where available and to \nthe extent agreed with the bank’s counterparties, Deutsche Bank also uses CCP clearing for its OTC derivative transactions.  \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 121, "text": " \n \n89  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisk and Capital Management \nAnnual Report 2024 \nCredit Risk Management \nThe Dodd-Frank Act and related Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) rules require CCP clearing in the United \nStates for certain standardized OTC derivative transactions, including certain interest rate swaps and index credit default \nswaps, subject to limited exceptions when facing certain counterparties. The European Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 on \nOTC Derivatives, CCPs and Trade Repositories (EMIR) and the Commission Delegated Regulations (EU) 2015/2205, (EU) \n2015/592 and (EU) 2016/1178 based thereupon introduced mandatory CCP clearing in the EU for certain standardized \nOTC derivatives transactions. Mandatory CCP clearing in the EU began for certain interest rate derivatives on June 21, \n2016 and for certain iTraxx-based credit derivatives and additional interest rate derivatives on February 9, 2017. Article 4 \n(2) of EMIR authorizes competent authorities to exempt intragroup transactions from mandatory CCP clearing, provided \ncertain requirements, such as full consolidation of the intragroup transactions and the application of an appropriate \ncentralized risk evaluation, measurement and control procedure are met. The bank successfully applied for the clearing \nexemption for a number of its regulatory-consolidated subsidiaries with intragroup derivatives, including e.g., Deutsche \nBank Securities Inc. and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. As of December 31, 2024, the bank is allowed to make use of \nintragroup exemptions from the EMIR clearing obligation for a number of bilateral intragroup relationships. The extent of \nthe exemptions differs as not all entities enter into relevant transaction types subject to the clearing obligation. Of the \nintragroup relationships, some are relationships where both entities are established in the European Union (EU) for which \na full exemption has been granted, and most are relationships where one is established in a third country (“Third Country \nRelationship”). Third Country Relationships required repeat applications for each new asset class being subject to the \nclearing obligation; the process took place in the course of 2017. Due to “Brexit”, the status of some group entities has \nchanged from an EU entity to a third country entity, but there has been no impact for the bank in respect clearing \nexemptions. Due to amendments of EMIR entering into force 24 December 2024, there are some changes to the intragroup \nexemption requirements, but, as a matter of principle, Deutsche Bank will be able to continue to use pre-existing clearing \nexemptions. \nThe rules and regulations of CCPs typically provide for the bilateral set off of all amounts payable on the same day and in \nthe same currency (“payment netting”) thereby reducing the bank’s settlement risk. Depending on the business model \napplied by the CCP, this payment netting applies either to all of the bank’s derivatives cleared by the CCP or at least to \nthose that form part of the same class of derivatives. Many CCPs’ rules and regulations also provide for the termination, \nclose-out and netting of all cleared transactions upon the CCP’s default (“close-out netting”), which reduces the bank’s \ncredit risk. In its risk measurement and risk assessment processes Deutsche Bank applies close-out netting only to the \nextent Deutsche Bank believes that the relevant CCP’s close-out netting provisions are legally valid and enforceable and \nhave been approved in accordance with the bank’s Netting Policy. \nIn order to reduce the credit risk resulting from OTC derivative transactions, where CCP clearing is not available, Deutsche \nBank regularly seeks the execution of standard master agreements (such as master agreements for derivatives published \nby the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) or the German Master Agreement for Financial \nDerivative Transactions with the bank’s counterparties. A master agreement allows for the close-out netting of rights and \nobligations arising under derivative transactions that have been entered into under such a master agreement upon the \ncounterparty’s default, resulting in a single net claim owed by or to the counterparty. Payment netting may be agreed from \ntime to time with the bank’s counterparties for multiple transactions having the same payment dates (e.g., foreign \nexchange transactions) pursuant to the terms of master agreements which can, reduce the bank’s settlement risk. In its \nrisk measurement and risk assessment processes Deutsche Bank applies close-out netting only to the extent Deutsche \nBank has concluded that the master agreement is legally valid and enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions and the \nrecognition of close-out netting has been approved in accordance with the bank’s Netting Policy . \nDeutsche Bank also enters into credit support annexes (CSAs) to master agreements in order to further reduce the bank’s \nderivatives-related credit risk. These annexes generally provide risk mitigation through periodic, usually daily, margining of \nthe covered exposure. The CSAs also provide for the right to terminate the related derivative transactions upon the \ncounterparty’s failure to honor a margin call. As with netting, when Deutsche Bank believes the annex is enforceable, \nDeutsche Bank reflects this in its exposure measurement. \nCertain CSAs to master agreements provide for rating-dependent triggers, where additional collateral must be pledged if \na party’s rating is downgraded. Deutsche Bank also enters into master agreements that provide for an additional \ntermination event upon a party’s rating downgrade. These downgrade provisions in CSAs and master agreements usually \napply to both parties but in some agreements may apply to Deutsche Bank only. Deutsche Bank analyzes and monitors its \npotential contingent payment obligations resulting from a rating downgrade in its stress testing and liquidity coverage \nratio approach for liquidity risk on an ongoing basis.

Certain documentation is also required by the U.S. margin rules adopted by U.S. \nprudential regulators. Under the U.S. prudential regulators’ margin rules, Deutsche Bank is required to post and collect \ninitial margin for its derivatives exposures with other derivatives dealers, as well as with the bank’s counterparties that (a) \nare “financial end users,” as that term is defined in the U.S. margin rules, and (b) have an average daily aggregate notional \namount of uncleared swaps, uncleared security-based swaps, foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange swaps \nexceeding U.S.$ 8 billion in June, July and August of the previous calendar year. The U.S. margin rules additionally requires \nDeutsche Bank to post and collect variation margin for its derivatives with other derivatives dealers and certain financial \nend user counterparties. These margin requirements are subject to a U.S.$ 50 million threshold for initial margin, but no \nthreshold for variation margin, with a combined U.S.$ 500,000 minimum transfer amount. The U.S. margin requirements \nhave been in effect for large banks since September 2016, with additional variation margin requirements having come into \neffect March 1, 2017 and additional initial margin requirements having been phased in from September 2017 through \nSeptember 2022. \nUnder Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/2251, which implements the EMIR margin requirements, the CSA \nmust provide for daily valuation and daily variation margining based on a zero threshold and a minimum transfer amount \nof not more than € 500,000. For large derivative exposures exceeding € 8 billion, initial margin has to be posted as well. \nThe variation margin requirements under EMIR apply as of March 1, 2017; the initial margin requirements originally were \nsubject to a staged phase-in until September 1, 2021. However, legislative changes published on February 17, 2021 \nextended deadlines into 2022. Under Article 31 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/2251, an EU party may \ndecide to not exchange margin with counterparties in certain non-netting jurisdictions provided certain requirements are \nmet. Pursuant to Article 11 (5) to (10) of EMIR, competent authorities are authorized to exempt intragroup transactions \nfrom the margining obligation, provided certain requirements are met. While some of those requirements are the same as \nfor the EMIR clearing exemptions (see above), there are additional requirements such as the absence of any current or \nforeseen practical or legal impediment to the prompt transfer of funds or repayment of liabilities between intragroup \ncounterparties. The bank is making use of this exemption. The bank has successfully applied for the collateral exemption \nfor some of its regulatory-consolidated subsidiaries with intragroup derivatives, including, e.g., Deutsche Bank Securities \nInc. and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. As of December 31, 2023, the bank is allowed to use intragroup exemptions from \nthe EMIR collateral obligation for a number of bilateral intragroup relationships which are published under db.com/legal-\nresources/european-market-infrastructure-regulation/intra-group-exemptions-margining. For some bilateral intragroup \nrelationships, the EMIR margining exemption may be used based on Article 11 (5) of EMIR, i.e. without the need for any \napplication or publication, because both entities are established in the same EU Member State. For third country \nsubsidiaries, the intragroup exemption was originally limited until the earlier of June 30, 2022 and four months after the \npublication of an equivalence decision by the EU Commission under Article 13(2) EMIR, unless, in the case of an \nequivalence decision being applicable, a follow-up exemption application is made and granted. On February 13, 2023, an \namendment to Regulation (EU) 2016/2251 has been published in the Official Journal, which amendment relates to the \nextension of the exemption end date until June 30, 2025. With the EMIR amendments having entered into force on \n24 December 2024 (Regulation (EU) 2024/2987), a so-called “equivalence decision” is no longer a requirement for a margin \nexemption. As a matter of principle, Deutsche Bank will be able to continue to use pre-existing margin exemptions. \nConcentrations within credit risk mitigation \nConcentrations within credit risk mitigations taken may occur if a number of guarantors and credit derivative providers \nwith similar economic characteristics are engaged in comparable activities with changes in economic or industry \nconditions affecting their ability to meet contractual obligations. Concentration risk may also occur in collateral portfolios \n(e.g. multiple claims and receivables against third parties) which are considered conservatively within the valuation process \nand/or on-site inspections where applicable. Deutsche Bank uses a range of tools and metrics to monitor its credit risk \nmitigating activities and potential concentrations. \nFor more qualitative and quantitative details in relation to the application of credit risk mitigation and potential \nconcentration effects please refer to the section “Maximum exposure to credit risk”. \n \n \n"}

This includes strategically setting, monitoring, reviewing, reporting, and controlling credit risk appetites across \nvarious dimensions such as Deutsche Bank Group, Corporate Division, Business Unit , legal entity, branch, country, and \nindustry level that need to be considered in the context of credit approvals. ERM Portfolio is also responsible for calibrating \nand monitoring the single name counterparty concentration grid that provides guidance to credit officers on limit sizing at \ncounterparty level. In addition, ERM Portfolio provides a comprehensive and holistic view of the bank’s risk profile across \nrisk types. \nOn a portfolio level, significant concentrations of credit risk could result from having material exposures to a number of \ncounterparties with similar economic characteristics, or who are engaged in comparable activities, where these similarities \nmay cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be affected in the same manner by changes in economic or \nindustry conditions. \nDeutsche Bank’s portfolio management framework supports a comprehensive assessment of concentrations within its \ncredit risk portfolio in order to keep concentrations within acceptable levels. \n Emerging Risks and portfolio developments are discussed at the monthly Credit Risk and Portfolio Management Forum \nwhich includes representation from senior credit risk managers including the Head of Credit Risk Management, as well as \nERM Portfolio. \nIndustry risk management \nTo manage industry risk, Deutsche Bank has grouped its corporate and financial institutions counterparties into various \nindustry sub-portfolios. Portfolios are regularly reviewed at least on an annual basis. Reviews highlight industry \ndevelopments and risks to the bank’s credit portfolio, review cross-risk concentration risks, analyze the risk/reward profile \nof the portfolio and incorporate the results of an economic downside stress test. Finally, this analysis is used to define the \ncredit strategies and risk appetite for respective industries. The setting of industry risk appetite takes into consideration \nthe group-wide credit risk appetite. \nIn the bank’s industry risk management framework, thresholds are established by ERM for aggregate credit limits to \ncounterparties within each industry sub-portfolio. For risk management purposes, the aggregation of limits across industry \nsectors follows an internal risk view that does not have to be congruent with NACE (Nomenclature des Activities \nEconomiques dans la Communate Europeenne) code-based view applied elsewhere in this report. Regular industry \nportfolio overviews are prepared for the Enterprise Risk Committee to discuss recent risk developments and to agree on \nrisk management actions where necessary. \nBeyond credit risk, the bank’s industry risk framework comprises of thresholds for Traded Credit Positions while key \nindustry relevant non-financial risks are considered. \nCountry risk management \nAvoiding undue concentrations from a regional and country perspective is also an integral part of the bank’s credit risk \nmanagement framework. In order to achieve this, country risk thresholds are applied to countries in Non-Japan Asia, \nCentral Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa and Latin America as well as selected Developed Markets countries (based \non internal country risk ratings). These thresholds are set for all counterparties based on their assigned specific ‘country of \nrisk’, which reflects a counterparty’s main (macro) economic risk, balance sheet earnings, jurisdiction, or other financial \ndependencies. Country of risk is typically aligned with the counterparty’s 'country of domicile’. \nCountry portfolios are regularly reviewed with the frequency of review dependent on portfolio size and risk profile as well \nas risk developments. Larger/riskier portfolios are reviewed at least on an annual basis. These reviews assess amongst other \nfactors, key macroeconomic and political risk developments and outlook; portfolio composition, quality and cross-risk \nconcentrations under normal and stress conditions. Based on this and taking into account the Group’s Risk Appetite and \nstrategy, country risk appetite and strategies are set by ERM.  \n \n \n"}

Beyond credit risk, the bank’s country risk \nframework comprises thresholds for trading positions that measure the aggregate market value of traded credit risk \npositions. For Emerging Markets, market risk thresholds are also set to measure the profit and loss impact under specific \ncountry stress scenarios on trading positions across the bank’s portfolio. Furthermore, thresholds are set for capital and \nintra-group funding exposure of Deutsche Bank entities in above countries given the transfer risk inherent in these cross-\nborder positions. Key non-financial risks are considered and factored into financial threshold setting considerations where \nrelevant. Deutsche Bank’s country risk ratings represent a key tool in its assessment of country risk. They include: \n– Sovereign rating (set and managed by ERM Risk Research): A measure of the probability of the sovereign defaulting on \nits foreign or local currency obligations \n– Transfer risk rating (set and managed by ERM Risk research): A measure of the probability of a “transfer risk event”, i.e., \nthe risk that an otherwise solvent debtor is unable to meet its obligations due to inability to obtain foreign currency or \nto transfer assets as a result of direct sovereign intervention \nAll sovereign and transfer risk ratings are reviewed, at least on an annual basis.  \nClimate and environmental risk management \nThe bank established a dedicated framework for the management of climate and environmental risks. The framework sets \nout key requirements around governance, risk identification and materiality assessment, risk appetite, risk monitoring, \ncontrols and stress testing.  \nConcentrations of climate and environmental risks are monitored, via dedicated reports, by key committees of the Bank \n(e.g., Enterprise Risk Committee and the Group Risk Committee), and are managed through: \n– Risk Appetite thresholds around the bank’s decarbonization targets, established for eight priority sectors (Upstream Oil \nand Gas, Power Generation, Automotives - Light Duty, Steel, Coal Mining, Cement and Aviation) and the overall financed \nemissions of the Corporate Loan Book \n– Early Warning Indicators, established across different portfolios (Corporates, Sovereigns and Fis) for climate-transition, \nclimate-physical and nature-related risks \nNew transactions with a significant impact on the bank’s financed emissions and/or net-zero targets are reviewed by the \nGroup Net-Zero Forum consisting of senior representatives from the Business, Risk, and the Chief Sustainability Office. \nThe review of the forum’s members includes an assessment of client sustainability disclosures, transition strategies, \ndecarbonization targets and governance. New transactions must fit within Deutsche Bank’s internal sectoral risk appetite \naligned to net-zero targets. In 2024, the Group-level sectoral risk appetite metrics were cascaded to the divisions, to \nenhance their responsibility and support their business strategies. In this context, dedicated Divisional Net-Zero Fora in \nthe Corporate Bank and the Investment Bank have been established. \nProduct/Asset class specific risk management \nComplementary to the bank’s counterparty, industry and country risk approach, Deutsche Bank has a framework to \nmanage certain asset class risk concentrations and sets limits or thresholds where required for risk management purposes. \nFor purposes of DB’s internal portfolio risk management, asset classes are groups of financial exposures that exhibit similar \nperformance and behaviors in both normal operating conditions and under severe stress. The exposures in an asset class \nwill typically have a common characteristic or sensitivity to the same economic and/or market factors and business, legal \nand regulatory developments. When such characteristic or sensitivity is triggered, transactions in the asset class may react \nand perform in a similar manner. These are portfolios which the bank’s Risk division considers as having the potential for \nsizeable tail risks and require additional monitoring. Group-wide credit risk appetite is considered in the setting of asset \nclass risk limits or thresholds. \nPrivate Bank and certain Corporate Bank businesses are managed via product-specific strategies setting the bank’s risk \nappetite for portfolios with similar credit risk characteristics, such as the retail portfolios of mortgages and consumer \nfinance products as well as products for business clients. Risk analyses are performed on portfolio level including further \nbreakdown into business units as well as countries/regions. In Wealth Management, target levels are set for global \nconcentrations along products as well as based on type and liquidity of collateral. \n \n \n"}

These commitments include the undertaking to provide \nbank loans for syndication into the debt capital market and bridge loans for the issuance of notes. The inherent risks of \nbeing unsuccessful in the distribution of the facilities or the placement of the notes, comprise of a delayed distribution, \nfunding of the underlying loans as well as a pricing risk as some underwriting commitments are additionally exposed to \nmarket risk in the form of widening credit spreads. Where applicable, Deutsche Bank dynamically hedges this credit spread \nrisk to be within the approved market risk limit framework. \nA major asset class, in which Deutsche Bank is active in underwriting, is leverage lending, which Deutsche Bank mainly \nexecutes through its Leveraged Debt Capital Markets business unit. The business model is a fee-based‚ originate to \ndistribute approach focused on the distribution of largely unfunded underwriting commitments into the capital market. \nThe afore-mentioned risks regarding distribution and credit spread movement apply to this business unit, however, are \nmanaged under a range of specific notional as well as market risk limits. The latter require the business to also hedge its \nunderwriting pipeline against market dislocations. The fee-based model of the bank’s Leveraged Debt Capital Markets \nbusiness unit includes a restrictive approach to single-name risk concentrations retained on Deutsche Bank’s balance \nsheet, which results in a diversified overall portfolio without any material concentrations. The resulting longer-term on-\nbalance sheet portfolio is also subject to a comprehensive credit limit and hedging framework. \nDeutsche Bank also provides material underwriting activity through its Debt Capital Markets desk which is focused on \nsupporting Investment Grade and cross-over rated corporate borrowers, usually in connection with M&A transaction \nfinancing. These exposures are typically 12-24 month bridge loans, which are expected to be repaid by syndicated loans \nand/or capital markets issuance by the borrower. Deutsche Bank does not bear market placement or pricing risk on these \nexposures but faces funding risk and credit risk for the duration of the commitment, which are managed through notional \nunderwriting limits for the Group and an industry concentration framework. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 126, "text": " \n \n94  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisk and Capital Management \nAnnual Report 2024 \nMarket Risk Management \nMarket Risk Management \nMarket Risk framework \nThe vast majority of Deutsche Bank’s businesses are subject to market risk, defined as the potential for change in the \nmarket value of the Group’s trading and invested positions. Risk can arise from changes in interest rates, credit spreads, \nforeign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and other relevant parameters, such as market volatility and \nmarket implied default probabilities. The market risk can affect accounting, economic and regulatory views of the \nexposure. \nMarket Risk Management is part of Deutsche Bank’s independent Risk function and sits within the Market and Valuations \nRisk Management group. One of the primary objectives of Market Risk Management is to ensure that the business units’ \nrisk exposure is within the approved risk appetite commensurate with its defined strategy. To achieve this objective, Market \nRisk Management works closely together with risk takers (“the business units”) and other control and support groups. \nThe Group distinguishes between three substantially different types of market risk: \n– Trading market risk arises primarily through the market-making and client facilitation activities of the Investment Bank \ndivision. This involves taking positions in debt, equity, foreign exchange, other securities and commodities as well as in \nequivalent derivatives \n– Traded default risk arising from defaults and rating migrations relating to trading instruments \n– Non-trading market risk arises from market movements, primarily outside the activities of the trading units, in the \nbanking book and from off-balance sheet items; this includes interest rate risk, credit spread risk, investment risk and \nforeign exchange risk as well as market risk arising from pension schemes, guaranteed funds and equity compensation; \nnon-trading market risk also includes risk from the modeling of client deposits as well as savings and loan products \nMarket Risk Management governance is designed and established to promote oversight of all market risks, effective \ndecision-making and timely escalation to senior management. \nMarket Risk Management defines and implements a framework to systematically identify, assess, monitor and report the \nGroup’s market risk. Market risk managers identify market risks through active portfolio analysis and engagement with the \nbusiness units. \nMarket Risk measurement  \nThe Group aims to accurately measure all types of market risks by a comprehensive set of risk metrics embedding \naccounting, economic and regulatory considerations. \nThe market risks are measured by several internally developed key risk metrics and regulatory defined market risk \napproaches.  \nTrading Market Risk  \nThe Group’s primary mechanism to manage trading market risk is the application of the bank’s risk appetite framework of \nwhich the limit framework is a key component. The Management Board, supported by Market Risk Management, sets \ngroup-wide value-at-risk, economic capital and portfolio stress testing limits for market risk in the trading book. Market \nRisk Management allocates this overall appetite to the Corporate Divisions and their individual business units based on \nestablished and agreed business plans. Deutsche Bank also has business aligned heads within Market Risk Management \nwho establish business unit limits, by allocating the limit down to individual portfolios, geographical regions and types of \nmarket risks.  \nValue-at-risk, economic capital and portfolio stress testing limits are used for managing all types of market risk at an overall \nportfolio level. As an additional and important complementary tool for managing certain portfolios or risk types, Market \nRisk Management performs risk analysis and business specific stress testing. Limits are also set on sensitivity and \nconcentration/liquidity, exposure, business-level stress testing and event risk scenarios, taking into consideration business \nplans and the risk versus return assessment. \nBusiness units are responsible for adhering to the limits against which exposures are monitored and reported. The market \nrisk limits set by Market Risk Management are monitored on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, dependent on the risk \nmanagement tool being used.  \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 127, "text": " \n \n95  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisk and Capital Management \nAnnual Report 2024 \nMarket Risk Management \nInternally developed Market Risk Models \nValue-at-Risk (VaR) \nVaR is a quantitative measure of the potential loss (in value) of Fair Value positions due to market movements that should \nnot be exceeded in a defined period of time and with a defined confidence level.  \nThe Group’s value-at-risk for the trading businesses is based on historical simulation model (internal model approach) \npredominantly utilizing full revaluation, although some portfolios remain on a sensitivity-based approach. The approach is \nused for both Risk Management and capital requirements.  \nRisk management VaR is calibrated to a 99% confidence level and a one day holding period. This means we estimate there \nis a 1 in 100 chance that a mark-to-market loss from our trading positions will be at least as large as the reported VaR. For \nregulatory capital purposes, the VaR model is calibrated to a 99% confidence interval and a ten day holding period. \nThe calculation employs a historical simulation technique that uses one year of historical market data as input and \nobserved correlations between the risk factors during this one year period. \nThe VaR model is designed to take into account a comprehensive set of risk factors across all asset classes. Key risk factors \nare swap/government curves, index and issuer-specific credit curves, single equity and index prices, foreign exchange \nrates, commodity prices as well as their implied volatilities. To help ensure completeness in the risk coverage, second order \nrisk factors, e.g., money market basis, implied dividends, option-adjusted spreads and precious metals lease rates are also \nconsidered in the VaR calculation. The list of risk factors included in the VaR model is reviewed regularly and enhanced as \npart of ongoing model performance reviews. \nThe model incorporates both linear and, especially for derivatives, nonlinear impacts predominantly through a full \nrevaluation approach but it also utilizes a sensitivity-based approach for certain portfolios. The full revaluation approach \nuses the historical changes to risk factors as input to pricing functions. Whilst this approach is computationally expensive, \nit does yield a more accurate view of market risk for nonlinear positions, especially under stressed scenarios. The sensitivity-\nbased approach uses sensitivities to underlying risk factors in combination with historical changes to those risk factors.  \nFor each business unit a separate VaR is calculated for each risk type, e.g., interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity risk, \nforeign exchange risk and commodity risk. “Diversification effect” reflects the fact that the total VaR on a given day will be \nlower than the sum of the VaR relating to the individual risk types. Simply adding the VaR figures of the individual risk types \nto arrive at an aggregate VaR would imply the assumption that the losses in all risk types occur simultaneously. \nThe VaR enables the Group to apply a consistent measure across the fair value exposures. It allows a comparison of risk in \ndifferent businesses, and also provides a means of aggregating and netting positions within a portfolio to reflect \ncorrelations and offsets between different asset classes. Furthermore, it facilitates comparisons of the market risk both \nover time and against the daily trading results. \nWhen using VaR results a number of considerations should be taken into account. These include: \n– The use of historical market data may not be a good indicator of potential future events, particularly those that are \nextreme in nature; this “backward-looking” limitation can cause VaR to understate future potential losses (as in financial \ncredit crisis 2008/09), but can also cause it to be overstated immediately following a period of significant stress (as in \nCOVID-19 pandemic)  \n– The one day holding period does not fully capture the market risk arising during periods of illiquidity, when positions \ncannot be closed out or hedged within one day \n– VaR does not indicate the potential loss beyond the 99th quantile \n– Intra-day risk is not reflected in the end of day VaR calculation \n– There may be risks in the trading or banking book that are not fully captured in the VaR model (either partially captured \nor missing entirely) \nThe process of systematically capturing and evaluating risks currently not captured in the bank’s VaR model has been \nfurther developed and improved. An assessment is made to determine the level of materiality of these risks and material \nrisks are prioritized for inclusion in the bank’s internal model. Risks not in VaR are monitored and assessed on a regular basis \nthrough the Risk Not In VaR (RNIV) framework. This framework is consistent with the Historical Simulation approach which \nin turn yields a more accurate estimate of the contribution of these missing items and their potential capitalization. \nDeutsche Bank is committed to the ongoing development of the internal risk models, and substantial resources are \nallocated to review, validate and improve them. \n"}

The Group calculates a stressed value-at-risk measure using a 99% confidence level. Stressed VaR is calculated with \na holding period of ten days. The SVaR calculation utilizes the same systems, trade information and processes as those \nused for the calculation of value-at-risk. The only difference is that historical market data and observed correlations from \na period of significant financial stress (i.e., characterized by high volatilities) are used as an input for the historical \nsimulation.  \nThe stress period selection process for the stressed value-at-risk calculation is based on the comparison of VaR calculated \nusing historical time windows compared to the current SVaR. If a historical window produces a VaR which is higher than \nthe current SVaR, it is further investigated and the SVaR window can subsequently be updated accordingly. This process \nruns on a quarterly basis. \nDuring 2024, the stress period selection process for the Group was conducted as outlined above. As a result, the SVaR \nwindow used at various periods in 2024 included the financial credit crisis of 2008/09, the European sovereign crisis of \n2011/12 and COVID-19 crisis of 2019/20. \nIncremental Risk Charge  \nIncremental Risk Charge captures default and credit rating migration risks for credit-sensitive positions in the trading book. \nThe Group uses a Monte Carlo Simulation for calculating incremental risk charge as the 99.9% quantile of the portfolio loss \ndistribution over a one-year capital horizon under a constant position approach and for allocating contributory incremental \nrisk charge to individual positions.  \nThe model captures the default and migration risk in an accurate and consistent quantitative approach for all portfolios. \nImportant parameters for the incremental risk charge calculation are exposures, recovery rates, maturities, ratings with \ncorresponding default and migration probabilities and parameters specifying issuer correlations.  \nMarket Risk Standardized Approach  \nThe Market Risk Standardized Approach (“MRSA”) is used to determine the regulatory capital charge for the specific market \nrisk of trading book securitizations, for certain types of investment funds and for longevity risk as set out in CRR/CRD \nregulations. \nMarket Risk Stress Testing \nStress testing is a key risk management technique, which evaluates the potential effects of extreme market events and \nmovements in individual risk factors. It is one of the core quantitative tools used to assess the market risk of Deutsche \nBank’s positions and complements VaR and Economic Capital. Market Risk Management performs several types of stress \ntesting to capture the variety of risks (Portfolio Stress Testing, individual specific stress tests and Event Risk Scenarios) and \nalso contributes to Group-wide stress testing. These stress tests cover a wide range of severities designed to test the \nearnings stability and capital adequacy of the bank. \nTrading Market Risk Economic Capital \nDeutsche Bank’s trading market risk economic capital model-scaled Stressed VaR based EC (SVaR based EC) - comprises \ntwo core components, the “common risk” component covering risk drivers across all businesses and the “business-specific \nrisk” component, which enriches the Common Risk via a suite of Business Specific Stress Tests. Both components are \ncalibrated to historically observed severe market shocks. Common risk is calculated using a scaled version of the SVaR \nframework while Business Specific Stress Tests are designed to capture more product/business-related bespoke risks (e.g., \ncomplex basis risks) as well as higher order risks not captured in the common risk component. The SVaR based EC uses the \nMonte Carlo SVaR framework.  \n \n \n"}

Trading book exposures are monitored by Market Risk Management via single name concentration and portfolio \nthresholds which are set based upon rating, size and liquidity. Single name concentration risk thresholds are set for two \nkey metrics: Default Exposure, i.e., the P&L impact of an instantaneous default at the current recovery rate, and bond \nequivalent Market Value, i.e., default exposure at 0% recovery. In order to capture diversification and concentration effects \nwe perform a joint calculation for traded default risk economic capital and credit risk economic capital. Important \nparameters for the calculation of traded default risk are exposures, recovery rates and default probabilities as well as \nmaturities. The probability of joint rating downgrades and defaults is determined by the default and rating correlations of \nthe portfolio model. These correlations are specified through systematic factors that represent countries, geographical \nregions and industries. \nTrading Market Risk Reporting \nMarket Risk Management reporting creates transparency on the risk profile and facilitates the understanding of core \nmarket risk drivers to all levels of the organization. The Management Board and Senior Governance Committees receive \nregular reporting, as well as ad hoc reporting as required, on market risk, regulatory capital and stress testing.

On group level those are captured by the management board set limits for market risk economic capital \ncapturing exposures to all market risks across asset classes as well as earnings and economic value based limits for interest \nrate risk in the banking books. Those limits are cascaded down by market risk management to the divisional or portfolio \nlevel.

This includes gap risk, which \narises from the term structure of banking book instruments, basis risk, which describes the impact of relative changes in \ninterest rates for financial instruments that are priced using different interest rate curves, as well as option risk, which arises \nfrom option derivative positions or from optional elements embedded in financial instruments.  \nThe Group manages its IRRBB exposures using economic value as well as earnings based measures. The Group Treasury \nfunction is mandated to manage the interest rate risk centrally, with Treasury Risk Management acting as 2nd Line of \nDefense (LoD) independently assessing and challenging the implementation of the framework and adherence to the risk \nappetite. Group Audit in its role as the 3rd LoD is accountable for providing independent and objective assurance on the \nadequacy of the design, operating effectiveness and efficiency of the risk management system and systems of internal \ncontrol. The Group Asset & Liability Committee (“ALCo”) oversees and steers the Group’s structural interest risk position \nwith particular focus on banking book risks and the management of the net interest income. The ALCo monitors the \nsensitivity of financial resources and associated metrics to key market parameters such as interest rate curves and oversees \nadherence to divisional/business financial resource limits. \nEconomic value based measures look at the change in economic value of banking book assets, liabilities and off-balance \nsheet exposures resulting from interest rate movements, independent of the accounting treatment. Thereby the Group \nmeasures the change in economic value of equity (∆EVE) as the maximum decrease of the banking book economic value \nunder the six standard scenarios defined by the EBA in addition to internal stress scenarios for risk steering purposes. For \nthe reporting of internal stress scenarios and risk appetite the Group applies a few different modelling assumptions as used \nin this disclosure. When aggregating the economic value of equity ∆EVE across different currencies, DB adds up negative \nand positive changes without applying weight factors for positive changes. Furthermore, the Group is using behavioral \nmodel assumptions about the interest rate duration of own equity capital as well as non-maturity deposits from financial \ninstitutions. \nEarnings-based measures look at the expected change in net interest income (NII) resulting from interest rate movements \nover a defined time horizon, compared to a defined benchmark scenario. Thereby the Group measures net interest income \n∆NII as the maximum reduction under the six standard scenarios defined by the EBA in addition to internal stress scenarios \nfor risk steering purposes, compared to a market implied curve scenario, over a period of 12 months. \nThe Group employs mitigation techniques to hedge the interest rate risk arising from non-trading positions within given \nlimits. The interest rate risk arising from non-trading asset and liability positions is managed through Treasury Markets & \nInvestments. Thereby the Group uses derivatives and applies different hedge accounting techniques such as fair value \nhedge accounting or cash flow hedge accounting. For fair value hedges, the Group uses interest rate swaps and options \ncontracts to manage the fair value movements of fixed rate financial instruments due to changes in benchmark interest. \nFor hedges in the context of the cash flow hedge accounting, the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the exposure \nto cash flow variability of the variable rate instruments as a result of changes in benchmark interest rates.  \nThe Group assesses and measures hedge effectiveness of a hedging relationship based on the change in the fair value or \ncash flows of the derivative hedging instrument relative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item \nattributable to the hedged risk. \nThe “Model Risk Management” function performs independent validation of models used for IRRBB measurement, as for \nall market risk models, in line with Deutsche Bank’s group-wide risk governance framework.  \nThe calculation of VaR and sensitivities of interest rate risk is performed daily, whereas the measurement and reporting of \neconomic value interest rate and earnings risk is performed on a monthly basis. The Group generally uses the same metrics \nin its internal management systems as it applies for the disclosure in this report.  \nDeutsche Bank’s key modelling assumptions are applied to the positions in the Private Bank and Corporate Bank divisions. \nThose positions are subject to risk of changes in client’s behavior with regard to their deposits as well as loan products. \nThe Group regularly tests the assumptions and updates them where appropriate following a defined governance process. \nIn particular, the Group has made changes to its assumptions during the early phase of rising interest rates where a slower \nrepricing in deposits was observed than it was anticipated. \n \n \n"}

For the purpose of constructing the replicating portfolio, the \nportfolio of non-maturity deposits is clustered by dimensions such as business unit, currency, product and geographical \nlocation. The main dimensions influencing the repricing maturity are elasticity of deposit rates to market interest rates, \nvolatility of deposit balances and observable client behavior. For the reporting period the average repricing maturity \nassigned across all such replicating portfolios is 2.40 years and Deutsche Bank uses 15 years as the longest repricing \nmaturity. \nIn the loan and some of the term deposit products Deutsche Bank considers early prepayment/withdrawal behavior of its \ncustomers. The parameters are based on historical observations, statistical analyses and expert assessments. \nFurthermore, the Group generally calculates IRRBB related metrics in contractual currencies and aggregates the resulting \nmetrics for reporting purposes. When calculating economic value based metrics the commercial margin is excluded for \nmaterial parts of the balance sheet. \nCredit spread risk in the banking book \nDeutsche Bank is exposed to credit spread risk in the Banking Book (CSRBB) mainly from bonds held by Treasury for \nliquidity reserve and asset liability interest rate risk management activities. The credit spread risk in the banking book is \nmanaged by the businesses, with Market Risk Management acting as an independent oversight function ensuring that the \nexposure is within the approved risk appetite. The perimeter for the measurement and monitoring of CSRBB exposure \nextends beyond fair value assets and liabilities and also includes positions accounted for at amortized cost whose pricing \nis linked to an observable market benchmark. The calculation of credit spread sensitivities and value-at-risk for material \ncredit spread exposure is in general performed on a daily basis, the measurement and reporting of economic capital and \nspecific CSRBB stress tests are performed on a monthly basis. \nForeign exchange risk \nForeign exchange risk arises from non-trading asset and liability positions that are denominated in currencies other than \nthe functional currency of the respective entity. The majority of this foreign exchange risk is transferred through internal \nhedges to trading books within the Investment Bank and is therefore reflected and managed via the value-at-risk figures \nin the trading books. The remaining foreign exchange risks that have not been transferred are mitigated through match \nfunding the investment in the same currency, so that only residual risk remains in the portfolios. Small exceptions to above \napproach follow the general Market Risk Management monitoring and reporting process, as outlined for the trading \nportfolio. \nThe bulk of non-trading open foreign exchange risk arises from the foreign exchange translation of local capital into the \nreporting currency of the Group and related capital hedge positions. Thereby structural open long positions are taken for \na selected number of relevant currencies to immunize the sensitivity of the capital ratio of the Group against changes in \nthe exchange rates. \nEquity and investment risk \nNon-trading equity risk is arising predominantly from our non-consolidated investment holdings in the banking book and \nfrom our equity compensation plans. \nDeutsche Bank’s non-consolidated equity investment holdings in the banking book are categorized into strategic and \nalternative investment assets. Strategic investments typically relate to acquisitions made to support the bank’s business \nfranchise and are undertaken with a medium to long-term investment horizon. Alternative assets are comprised of principal \ninvestments and other non-strategic investment assets. Principal investments are direct investments in private equity, real \nestate, venture capital, hedge or mutual funds whereas assets recovered in the workout of distressed positions or other \nlegacy investment assets in private equity and real estate are of a non-strategic nature.  \nInvestment proposals for strategic investments as well as monitoring of progress and performance against committed \ntargets are evaluated by the Group Investment Committee.

Operational risk includes legal risks but excludes business and reputational risk and is embedded in all banking \nproducts and activities.” Operational risk forms a subset of the bank’s non-financial risks. \nDeutsche Bank’s operational risk appetite sets out the amount of operational risk it is willing to accept as a consequence \nof doing business. The bank takes on operational risks consciously, both strategically as well as in day-to-day business. \nWhile the bank may have no appetite for certain types of operational risk events (such as violations of laws or regulations \nand misconduct), in other cases a certain amount of operational risk must be accepted if the bank is to achieve its business \nobjectives. In case a residual risk is assessed to be outside risk appetite, risk reducing actions must be undertaken, including \nremediating the risks, insuring risks or ceasing business. \nThe Operational Risk Management Framework is a set of interrelated tools and processes that are used to identify, assess, \nmitigate and monitor the bank’s operational risks. Its components have been designed to operate together to provide a \ncomprehensive, risk-based approach to managing the bank’s most material operational risks. Operational Risk \nManagement Framework components include the Group’s approach to setting and adhering to operational risk appetite, \nthe operational risk type and control taxonomies, the policies and procedures for operational risk management processes \nincluding the respective tools, and the bank’s operational risk capital model. \nOrganizational and governance structure \nWhile the day-to-day management of operational risk is the primary responsibility of business divisions and infrastructure \nfunctions, where these risks are generated, Non-Financial Risk Management (NFRM) oversees the Group-wide \nmanagement of operational risks, identifies, and reports risk concentrations, and promotes a consistent application of the \nOperational Risk Management Framework across the bank. NFRM is part of the Group’s risk function, the Chief Risk Office, \nwhich is headed by the Chief Risk Officer.  \nThe Chief Risk Officer appoints the Head of NFRM, who is accountable for the design, oversight and maintenance of an \neffective, efficient and regulatory compliant Operational Risk Management Framework, including the operational risk \ncapital model. The Head of NFRM monitors and challenges the Operational Risk Management Framework’s Group wide \nimplementation and monitors overall risk levels against the bank’s operational risk appetite. \nThe Non-Financial Risk Committee is responsible for the oversight, governance, and coordination of the management of \noperational risk in the Group, by establishing a cross-risk and holistic perspective of the key operational risks of the Group. \nIts decision-making and policy related authorities include the review, advice and management of all operational risk issues \nthat may impact the risk profile of business divisions and infrastructure functions. Several sub-fora with attendees from \nboth the 1st LoD and 2nd LoD support the Non-Financial Risk Committee to effectively fulfil its mandate. In addition to \nthe Group level Non-Financial Risk Committee, business divisions have established 1st LoD non-financial risk fora for the \noversight and management of operational risks on various levels of the organization. \nThe governance of operational risks follows the bank’s 3LoD approach to managing all of its financial and non-financial \nrisks. The Operational Risk Management Framework establishes the operational risk governance standards including the \ncore 1st and 2nd LoD roles and their responsibilities, to ensure effective risk management and appropriate independent \nchallenge.  \nOperational risk requirements for the 1st LoD: Risk owners as the 1st LoD have full accountability for their operational risks \nand manage these against a defined risk appetite.  \nRisk owners are those roles in the bank whose activities generate - or who are exposed to - operational risks. As heads of \nbusiness divisions and infrastructure functions, they must determine the appropriate organizational structure to identify \ntheir operational risk profile, actively manage these risks within their organization, take business decisions on the mitigation \nor acceptance of operational risks to ensure they remain within risk appetite, and establish and maintain 1st LoD controls. \nOperational risk requirements for the 2nd LoD: Risk Type Controllers act as the 2nd LoD control functions for all sub-risk \ntypes under the overarching risk type “Operational Risk”.  \n"}

These enable the bank to \ndetermine its operational risk profile in relation to risk appetite for operational risk, to systematically identify operational \nrisk themes and concentrations, and to define risk mitigating measures and priorities. \nIn 2024, the bank continued to mature the management of Operational Risk. This was achieved through the enhancement \nof the granularity of the Risk and Control Assessment; through the migration of the central control repository into a more \nefficient application and by uplifting the Risk Appetite Framework. \nLoss data collection: Data on internal and relevant external operational risk events (with a P&L impact ≥ € 10,000) is \nindependently validated in a timely manner. Material operational risk events trigger clearly defined lessons learned and \nread-across analyses, which are performed in the 1st LoD in close collaboration between business partners, risk control \nand other infrastructure functions. Lessons learned reviews analyze the reasons for significant operational risk events, \nidentify their root causes, and document appropriate remediation actions to reduce the likelihood of their reoccurrence. \nRead across reviews take the conclusions of the lessons learned process and seek to analyze whether similar risks and \ncontrol weaknesses identified in a lessons learned review exist in other areas of the bank, even if they have not yet resulted \nin problems or losses. This allows preventative actions to be undertaken. \nScenario analysis: The operational risk profile is complemented and further substantiated by incorporating exploratory \nscenario analysis into day-to-day risk management activities. Scenario analysis is used as a risk identiﬁcation and \nmanagement tool that enables risk owners and Risk Type Controllers to explore potential exposure to risk as the basis for \nidentifying potential gaps in the banks existing operational risk profile. Furthermore, it is used as an input into the \ncalculation of the operational risk capital for the bank. Scenario storylines build on internal losses, emerging risk reviews, \ntop risks and risk concentrations, and findings, as well as the review of external peer operational risk loss events. \nInformation from actual and potential future loss events are systematically utilized to identify thematic susceptibilities \nand actively seek to reduce the likelihood of similar incidents, for example through deep dive analyses or risk profile \nreviews. In 2024, the new ‘Structured scenario’ approach was piloted, which allows for better quantification of potential \nOperational Risks. \n \n \n"}

The Risk & Control Assessment is \nperformed at a global business level and as such covers all jurisdictions. It is designed to assist Senior Management to \ndetermine whether operational risks are being managed and controlled adequately via a dynamic assessment approach \nwhich covers all applicable Risk Types from the Group’s Non-Financial Risk Type Taxonomy (NFRTT). The Risk & Control \nAssessment puts a greater emphasis on assessing and mitigating risks that are outside of appetite and risks that drive \nunethical and inappropriate market conduct within the bank. In 2024, the RCA granularity was enhanced to provide \nspecific risk insights and ensuring a more accurate risk profile for comparison against the defined risk appetite. \nTop risks: The Top Risk Reporting process is a regular process to identify the risks which pose greatest concern across \nGroup and divisions, in addition to ensuring there is commensurate remediation activity associated to mitigate the risk. The \nassociated Top Risk reporting provides a forward-looking perspective on the impact of top risk reduction programs, \ncomprising of planned remediation and control enhancements, indicating the expected timeframe for reduction. The \nreporting also contains emerging risks and themes that have the potential to influence the top risk population in the future. \nThe top risk identification process is closely connected to both the risk and control assessment and risk appetite, \nconsuming the risk exposure from the former and the appetite levels from the latter to help inform the top risk population. \nIn 2024, the Top Risk Reporting Process was decommissioned and integrated into the risk appetite process. \nTransformation Risk Assessment: To identify and appropriately manage risks from material change initiatives within the \nbank, a transformation risk assessment process is in place to assess the impact of transformation (including bank’s future \njoint ventures and strategic investments) on the bank’s risk profile and control environment. The assessment considers \nimpacts to financial and non-financial risk types and is mandatory for a subset of initiatives, categorized as key deliverables \n(typically includes regulatory initiatives, technology migrations, remediation initiatives, strategy and organizational \nchanges).  \nRisk appetite: Non-financial risk appetite reflects the amount of non-financial risk the bank is willing to accept to pursue \nits strategy. The non-financial risk appetite framework provides a common approach to define the level of risk appetite \nacross the firm and monitor exposure against this appetite. The operational risk profile is regularly monitored against the \nbank’s defined risk appetite, to alert the organization on impending problems in a timely fashion. In 2024, the concept of \nresidual risk zones was further enhanced by introducing Operating Conditions the 1st LOD must operate within. This allows \nfor a more precise articulation of risk appetite for a given risk type including defined breach and consequences \nmanagement requirements. \nFindings and issue management: The findings and issue management process facilitates mitigating the risks associated \nwith known control weaknesses and deficiencies, and enables management to make risk-based decisions over the need \nfor further remediation or risk acceptance. Outputs from the findings management process must be able to demonstrate \nto internal and external stakeholders that the bank is actively identifying its control weaknesses and taking steps to \nmanage associated risks within acceptable levels of risk appetite.  \nFramework Adherence: Operational Risk Framework Adherence monitoring is a key activity to oversee, monitor and test \nthe conformity to OR Framework component requirements by key stakeholders in the 1st and 2nd LoD. Operational Risk \nFramework Adherence results aim to proactively identify implementation improvements required of users of the OR \nFramework and highlight potential Framework design improvements. In 2024 framework adherence consequence \nmanagement was enhanced whereby material adherence deficiencies identified through framework adherence reviews \nwill result in risk-identified issues against the responsible 1st or 2nd LoD function, unless a finding already exists to \nappropriately remediate the deficiency identified. \n \n \n"}

The Operational Risk Management Framework is a set of interrelated tools and processes that are used to identify, \nassess, measure, monitor and mitigate Deutsche Bank Group’s operational risks according to regulatory and industry-\nestablished definition of operational risk. It applies to the operational sub-risk types on a more granular level and enables \nthe bank to aggregate and monitor its operational risk profile. These operational sub-risk types are controlled by various \ninfrastructure functions and include the following: \n– The Compliance department performs an independent 2nd line control function that protects the bank’s license to \noperate by promoting and enforcing compliance with the law and driving a culture of compliance and ethical conduct \nin the bank. The Compliance department assists, reviews and challenges the business divisions and works with other \ninfrastructure functions and regulators to establish and maintain a risk-based approach to the management of the \nbank’s compliance risks in accordance with the bank’s risk appetite and to help the bank detect, mitigate and prevent \nbreaches of laws, rules and regulations as well as internal policies. The Compliance department performs the following \nprincipal activities: regulatory engagement and management in collaboration with Regulatory and Exam Management \nGroup; identification and assessment of new and changed laws, rules and regulations; acting as trusted advisor through \nindependent review and challenge; performing second line controls; the identification, assessment, mitigation, \nmonitoring and reporting on compliance risk; the results of these assessments and controls are regularly reported to \nthe Management Board and Supervisory Board. \n– Financial crime risks are managed by the Anti-Financial Crime (AFC) function via maintenance and development of a \ndedicated program; the AFC program is based on regulatory and supervisory requirements; AFC has defined roles and \nresponsibilities and established dedicated functions for the identification and management of financial crime risks \nresulting from money laundering, terrorism financing, compliance with sanctions and embargoes, the facilitation of tax \nevasion as well as other criminal activities including fraud, bribery and corruption and other crimes; AFC updates its \nstrategy for financial crime prevention via regular development of internal policies processes and controls, institution-\nspecific risk assessment and staff training \n– Legal & Group Governance is a fully independent infrastructure function, mandated to provide legal advice both to the \nManagement Board as well as to the business divisions and infrastructure functions and to support the Management \nBoard in setting up and guarding Deutsche Bank’s Governance framework and manage the bank’s Legal and Governance \nRisk. Legal has a monopoly for giving legal advice, retaining and controlling outside counsel. \nThe independency of Legal & Group Governance is ensured through \n– a direct reporting line into the Management Board and not into any business division \n– a ring-fenced incentive system and compensation where performance evaluation is tied principally to risk \nmanagement and not to business revenues \n– Deutsche Bank’s New Product Approval and Systematic Product Review processes form a control framework designed \nto manage the risks associated with new products and services and their lifecycle management; these processes are \noverseen by Product Governance, within the Non-Financial Risk function; existing products and services are reviewed \nin one- to three year cycles designed to assess whether they remain fit for purpose and consistent with their respective \ntarget markets’ characteristics and objectives; each product or service must be sponsored by a business Managing \nDirector who bears ultimate accountability for it; breaches of the New Product Approval requirements are in scope of \nthe bank’s Red Flag consequence management process \n– NFRM function includes the Risk Type Controller role for a number of non-financial and operational resilience risks; its \nmandate includes second line oversight of controls over transaction processing activities, as well as infrastructure risks \nto prevent technology or process disruption, maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, records and \ninformation security, and ensure business divisions and infrastructure functions have robust plans in place to recover \nimportant business processes and functions in the event of disruption including technical or building outage, or the \neffects of cyber-attack or natural disaster as well as any physical security or safety risk; NFRM Risk Type Controller also \nmanages the risks arising from the bank’s internal and external vendor engagements via the provision of a \ncomprehensive third party risk management framework. \n \n \n"}

The AMA capital calculation is based upon the loss distribution \napproach. Gross losses from historical internal and external loss data (Operational Riskdata eXchange Association \nconsortium data) complemented by scenario data are used to estimate the risk profile (i.e., a loss frequency and a loss \nseverity distribution). The loss distribution approach model includes conservatism by recognizing losses on events that \narise over multiple years as single events in the historical loss profile. \nWithin the loss distribution approach model, the frequency and severity distributions are combined in a Monte Carlo \nsimulation to generate potential losses over a one-year time horizon. Finally, the risk mitigating benefits of insurance are \napplied to each loss generated in the Monte Carlo simulation. Correlation and diversification benefits are applied to the \nnet losses in a manner compatible with regulatory requirements to arrive at a net loss distribution at Group level, covering \nexpected and unexpected losses. Capital is then allocated to each of the business divisions considering qualitative \nadjustments after deducting expected loss. \nThe regulatory and economic capital requirements for operational risk is derived from the 99.9% percentile. Both \nregulatory and economic capital requirements are calculated for a time horizon of one year. \nThe regulatory and economic capital demand calculations are performed on a quarterly basis. NFRM establishes and \nmaintains the approach for capital demand quantification and ensures that appropriate development, validation and \nchange governance processes are in place, whereby the validation is performed by an independent validation function and \nin line with the Group’s model risk management process. \nWith the go-live of the European Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR3), the regulatory capital requirement will no \nlonger be based on the AMA methodology from 2025 onwards. Instead, the Standardized Measurement Approach for \noperational risk will be used. Deutsche Bank will continue to apply the AMA methodology to calculate its economic capital \nrequirement. \nDrivers for operational risk capital development  \nBy design of the AMA capital calculation, Deutsche Bank’s operational risk capital demand is predominantly driven by \nhistorical internal loss events. \nIn view of the relevance of legal risks within the bank’s operational risk profile, specific attention is dedicated to the \nmanagement and measurement of open civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters where the bank relies both on \ninformation from internal as well as external data sources to consider developments in legal matters that affect the bank \nspecifically but also the banking industry as a whole. Reflecting the multi-year nature of legal proceedings the \nmeasurement of these risks furthermore takes into account changing levels of certainty by capturing the risks at various \nstages throughout the lifecycle of a legal matter.  \nConceptually, the bank measures operational risk including legal risk by determining the annual operational risk loss that \nwill not be exceeded with a given probability. This loss amount is driven by a component that due to the IFRS criteria is \nreflected in the bank’s financial statements and a component beyond the amount reflected as provisions within the bank’s \nfinancial statements. \nThe legal losses which the bank expects with a likelihood of more than 50% are already reflected in the IFRS group financial \nstatements. These losses include net changes in provisions for existing and new cases in a specific period where the loss is \ndeemed probable and is reliably measurable in accordance with IAS 37. \nUncertain legal losses which are not reflected in the bank’s financial statements as provisions because they do not meet \nthe recognition criteria under IAS 37 are considered within “regulatory or economic capital demand”. \nTo quantify the litigation losses in the AMA model, the bank takes into account historical losses, provisions, contingent \nliabilities and legal forecasts. Legal forecasts generally comprise ranges of potential losses covering risks of outflows \ngreater than the provision and adjustments which are deemed remote or relate to yet unknown matters. Such forecasts \nmay result from ongoing and new legal matters which are reviewed at least quarterly by the attorneys handling the legal \nmatters. \nThe legal forecasts are included in the “relevant loss data” used in the AMA model. The projection range of the legal \nforecasts is not restricted to the one year capital time horizon but goes beyond and conservatively assumes early \nsettlement of the underlying losses in the reporting period - thus considering the multi-year nature of legal matters. \n"}

The Group’s risk taxonomy differentiates between two aspects of liquidity risk: Short-\nterm liquidity risk and Structural funding risk, both embedded in an overarching liquidity risk management framework. The \nframework’s objective is to ensure that robust governance and controls are established within the Group to fulfil its \npayment obligations (including intraday) at all times, including periods of stress and to manage its liquidity and funding \nrisks within the Management Board’s approved risk appetite, when executing the strategic plan. The framework considers \nall relevant and significant drivers of liquidity risk, whether on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet. \nLiquidity and funding risk framework \nThe Management Board defines the liquidity and funding risk strategy for the Group and sets the risk appetite, based on \nrecommendations made by the Group Risk Committee. The Management Board reviews and approves the risk appetite at \nleast annually. The risk appetite is applied at the Group level and to internally defined Key Liquidity Entities e.g., Deutsche \nBank AG to monitor and control liquidity risk as well as the Group’s long-term funding and issuance plan. \nThe Liquidity Risk Management Framework defines the organization of the liquidity managing functions in alignment with \nthe three lines of defense structure, which is described in the “Risk Management Policy”. The Corporate Divisions and \nTreasury comprise the first line of defense, responsible for executing the steps needed to most effectively manage the \nliquidity of the Group and steer business activities. CRO comprises the second line of defense, responsible for defining the \nliquidity risk management framework, providing independent risk oversight, challenge, and validation of activities \nconducted by the first line of defense, including establishing the risk appetite. Group Audit comprises the third line of \ndefense, responsible for overseeing the activities of both the first line of defense and second line of defense. \nThe Group Asset and Liability Committee is the Group’s decision making governing body mandated by the Management \nBoard to optimize the sourcing and deployment of the Group’s balance sheet and financial resources in line with the \nManagement Board’s risk appetite and strategy. The Group Asset and Liability Committee has the overarching \nresponsibility to define, approve and optimize the Group’s funding strategy. Regarding the second line of defense the \nGroup Risk Committee is mandated by the Management Board with decision-making authority regarding material risk-\nrelated topics. In addition, it reviews and recommends items for the Management Board’s approval, including key risk \nmanagement principles, the Group’s risk appetite statement, recovery plan, the contingency funding plan, over-arching \nrisk appetite parameters, and recovery and escalation indicators. \nThe Group’s liquidity risk management principles are documented in the “Group Liquidity Risk Management Policy” and \nthe framework is described in the “Global Liquidity Risk Framework” and “Global Funding Risk Framework” documents. \nBoth the policy and framework documents adhere to and articulate how the eight key risk management practices are \napplied to liquidity risk, with such key practices including risk governance, risk organization (3 lines of defense), risk culture, \nrisk appetite and -strategy, risk identification and -assessment, risk mitigation and controls, risk measurement and \nreporting, stress planning and -execution. The individual roles and responsibilities relevant to each of these practices are \nlaid out and documented in the Global Responsibility Matrix for liquidity risk, which provides further clarity and \ntransparency on the roles and responsibilities across all involved stakeholders. All additional procedures and supporting \ndocuments (both global and local) issued by the liquidity risk management functions further define the requirements \nspecific to liquidity risk practices.

This Risk \nAppetite Statement is further underpinned by the liquidity risk controls framework consisting of ”Key Limits” based on risk \nappetite, as well as a suite of additional limits, thresholds and early warning indicators. \nDeutsche Bank implemented a dedicated Risk Appetite framework covering regulatory Pillar 1 as well as internal stress \nmetrics (Pillar 2), thus ensuring that the Group’s liquidity position is balanced on a consolidated basis at the Group level as \nwell as across Key Liquidity Entities and across currencies. \nTreasury manages liquidity and funding, in accordance with the risk appetite across a range of relevant metrics and \nimplements several tools including business level risk limits further cascading aspects of risk appetite to divisional level, \nensuring ease of compliance with business level risk limits. As such, Treasury works closely with Liquidity Risk Management \nunder its delegated authority and the business divisions to identify, analyze and monitor underlying liquidity risk \ncharacteristics within business portfolios. These parties are engaged in regular dialogue regarding changes in the Group’s \nliquidity position arising from business activities and market events. \nFurthermore, the Group ensures at the level of each Liquidity Relevant Entity that all local liquidity metrics are managed \nin compliance with the defined risk appetite. Local liquidity surpluses are pooled in Deutsche Bank AG hubs and local \nliquidity shortfalls can be met through support from these hubs. Transfers of liquidity capacity between entities are subject \nto the Intercompany Funding approval framework involving the Group’s liquidity steering function as well as the local \nliquidity managers considering the compliance with Pillar 1 metrics including Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Net Stable \nFunding Ratio (NSFR) as well as the stressed Net Liquidity Position (sNLP), which is a Pillar 2 metric. Any available surplus \nthat resides in entities with restrictions on transferring liquidity to other Group entities, due to for example regulatory \nlending requirements, is treated as trapped and as such not considered in the calculation of the consolidated Group \nliquidity surplus. \nThe Management Board is informed about the Group’s performance against the key liquidity metrics, including the risk \nappetite and internal and market indicators, via a weekly liquidity dashboard. \nLiquidity risk monitoring and management  \nFinance teams - Liquidity & Treasury Reporting & Analysis (LTRA) and Global Reporting, together own the overall \naccountability for the accurate and timely production of both external regulatory liquidity reporting (Pillar 1) as well as \ninternal management reporting (Pillar 2) for the liquidity risk of the Group. In addition, Liquidity & Treasury Reporting & \nAnalysis is responsible for the development of management information systems and the related analysis to support the \nliquidity risk framework and its governance for Treasury and Liquidity Risk Management. \nLiquidity Coverage Ratio \nThe LCR, which is also a key regulatory and risk appetite limit, is intended to promote the short-term resilience of a bank’s \nliquidity risk profile over a 30-day stress scenario. The ratio is defined as the amount of High-Quality Liquid Assets that \ncould be used to raise liquidity in a stressed scenario, measured against the total volume of net cash outflows, arising from \nboth contractual and prescribed modelled exposures over a 30-day time horizon on a consolidated currency basis. \nBy maintaining a ratio in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements, the LCR seeks to ensure that the Group holds \nadequate liquidity resources to mitigate a short-term liquidity stress. \nAn internal liquidity stress test position (sNLP) is also calculated and monitored to assist in liquidity steering. Key \ndifferences between the internal liquidity stress test (sNLP) and the LCR include the risk appetite time horizon (eight weeks \nversus 30 days, respectively), the classification and haircut differences between debt securities within the sNLP and the \nLCR High-Quality Liquid Assets, outflow rates for various categories of funding, as well as inflow assumption for various \nassets (for example, loan repayments). The Group’s internal liquidity stress test also includes outflows related to intraday \nliquidity assumptions, which are not explicitly reflected in the LCR. \n \n \n"}

The ratio is defined as the amount of Available Stable Funding (the \nportion of capital and liabilities expected to be a stable and/or consistent source of funding), relative to the amount of \nRequired Stable Funding for different types of on-balance sheet assets (with Required Stable Funding levels, a function of \nthe liquidity characteristics of various assets held). \nBased on the risk appetite, a NSFR limit has been set for the Group as well as for all Key Liquidity Entities and Liquidity \nRelevant Entities subject to a respective regulatory requirement to ensure ongoing compliance. \nLiquidity stress testing and scenario analysis \nGlobal internal liquidity stress testing and scenario analysis is used for measuring liquidity risk and evaluating the Group’s \nshort-term liquidity position within the liquidity framework. This complements the daily operational cash management \nprocess. The long-term liquidity strategy based on contractual and behavioral modelled cash flow information is \nrepresented by a long-term metric known as the Funding Matrix (refer to Funding risk management and funding \ndiversification section below for additional information). \nThe global liquidity stress testing process is managed by Treasury towards a respective risk appetite. Treasury is \nresponsible for the design of the overall methodology, the choice of liquidity risk drivers and the determination of \nappropriate assumptions (parameters) to translate input data into stress testing output. Liquidity Risk Management is \nresponsible for the definition of the stress scenarios. Laid out by the Model Risk Management Policy and Procedure, \nLiquidity Risk Management and Model Risk Management perform the independent validation of liquidity risk models. \nFinance teams -Liquidity & Treasury Reporting & Analysis and Global Reporting, are responsible for implementing these \nmethodologies and performing the stress test calculation in conjunction with Treasury, Liquidity Risk Management, Group \nStrategic Analytics and IT. \nStress testing and scenario analysis are used to describe and evaluate the impact of sudden and severe stress events on \nthe Group’s liquidity position. Deutsche Bank has selected four scenarios to calculate the Group’s stressed Net Liquidity \nPosition. These scenarios are designed to capture potential outcomes which may be experienced by the Group. The most \nsevere scenario assesses the potential consequences of a combined market-wide and idiosyncratic stress event, including \ndowngrades of Deutsche Bank credit rating. Under each of the scenarios, the impact of a liquidity stress event over \ndifferent time horizons and across multiple liquidity risk drivers, covering all business lines and product areas and with that \nall portfolios and balance sheet, is considered. The output from this scenario analysis feeds the Group Wide Stress Test \nrun by the Enterprise Risk Management, which analysis liquidity risk in conjunction with the other defined risk types and \nevaluates their impact and interplay to both - Capital and Liquidity positions. \nIn addition, potential funding requirements from contingent liquidity risks which can arise under stress, including \ndrawdowns on lending facilities, increased collateral requirements under derivative agreements, and outflows from \ndeposits with a contractual rating linked trigger are included in the analysis. Subsequently, countermeasures, which are \nthe actions the Group would take to counterbalance the outflows incurred during a stress event, are taken into \nconsideration. These countermeasures include the usage of the Group’s liquidity reserve and generating liquidity from \nother unencumbered, marketable assets without causing any material impact on the Group’s business model. \nStress testing is conducted at a global level and for defined entities relevant for liquidity risk management. The stress \nanalysis covers an eight-week stress horizon which is considered to be the most critical time span during a liquidity crisis \nrequiring that liquidity is actively assessed and steered on a Group level. In addition to the consolidated currency stress \ntest, further stress tests are performed for material currencies, namely EUR and USD. At the global level as well as for the \nU.S. liquidity stress tests also cover a twelve-months period whereby a risk appetite key limit has also been set. Ad-hoc \nanalysis may be conducted to reflect the impact of potential downside events that could affect the Group such as \nclimate/ESG-related events. Relevant stress assumptions are applied to reflect liquidity flows from risk drivers and on-\nbalance sheet and off-balance sheet products. The suite of stress testing scenarios and assumptions are reviewed on a \nregular basis and are updated when enhancements are made to stress testing methodologies. \n \n \n"}

These are considered for risk management and steering purposes in addition to the Pillar 1 requirements.  \nThe Group relies on a vast range of funding sources including deposits, unsecured wholesale funding, Capital Markets \nIssuances and secured funding. These funding sources protect the Group’s liquidity position two ways. First, since stress \nevents may impact funding markets differently, maintaining a well-diversified funding portfolio will lower the average \nimpact of these events. Second, when experiencing a liquidity stress, having access to a wide range of funding sources \nsignificantly improves the Group’s ability to tap different funding markets. The diversification across products is \ncomplemented by Risk thresholds which have been set to monitor tenor concentration and counterparty concentration \nfor both secured and unsecured funding sources.  \nThe stability of Deutsche Bank Group’s funding position can be negatively impacted by various forms of industry risks \nwhich often manifests medium to long term structural trends with a potentially significant long-term impact on the \neconomy and banks’ balance sheets. Deutsche Bank performs ad-hoc analyses on such emerging risks to assess the impact \nof such trends on its funding position to ensure that mitigating measures are taken on a timely basis when deemed \nnecessary. In addition, Treasury evaluates current market access information in its significant funding markets on a monthly \nbasis with results compiled and presented to the Group Asset and Liability Committee. \nDeutsche Bank’s tool for monitoring and managing the Group’s funding profile for greater than one year time horizon, is \nthe Funding Matrix. To produce the Funding Matrix, all assets and liabilities are mapped into time buckets corresponding \nto their baseline contractual or modelled maturities. This allows the Group to identify expected excesses and shortfalls in \nterm liabilities over assets in each time bucket, facilitating the management of potential liquidity exposures over time. The \nliquidity profile is based on contractual cash flow information. If the contractual maturity profile of a product does not \nadequately reflect the liquidity profile or in case of non-maturing products, the maturity is replaced by baseline modelling \nassumptions. \nCapital Markets Issuance \nThe main objective of debt issuance is to raise medium term funding in the most cost optimal manner. Debt issuance, \nencompassing senior unsecured bonds, covered bonds, and capital securities, is a key source of term funding for the Group \nand is managed directly by Treasury. At least once a year, following endorsement by the Asset and Liability Committee, \nTreasury submits an annual long-term funding plan to the Group Risk Committee for recommendation and then to \nManagement Board for approval. This plan is driven by global and local funding and liquidity requirements based on \nexpected business development. The Group’s capital markets issuance portfolio is dynamically managed through annual \nissuance plans to avoid excessive maturity concentrations. \nDeutsche Bank holds a license to issue mortgage Pfandbriefe and maintains a program to issue structured covered bonds. \nIn 2024, the Pfandbrief platform was enriched to support callable Pfandbriefe which further broadens the bandwidth \noffered to investors. Additionally, the Group continues to run a program for the purpose of issuing covered bonds under \nSpanish law (Cedulas). In 2023, Deutsche Bank further diversified its investor base through inaugural transactions in China. \nThe issuances of these so-called Panda bonds was expanded throughout 2024. Since 2020 the Group maintains its Green \nBond framework which the bank offers green note issuances to both, institutional and retail investors. Furthermore, \nmultiple green structured notes, first green deposits and first green repurchase agreements (repos) were executed. In \n2024, sustainability framework was enriched to also support social assets. This was utilized for the first time in July 2024 \nthrough the issuance of DB’s inaugural social bond. \n \n \n"}

HQLA \ncomprise available cash and cash equivalents and unencumbered high quality liquid securities (including government and \ngovernment guaranteed bonds), representing the most readily available and most important countermeasure in a stress \nevent. \nThe vast majority of the Group’s HQLA are held centrally across major currencies at the central bank accounts of the parent \nentity and foreign branches in the key locations in which we are active and in a dedicated Treasury-owned Strategic \nliquidity reserves portfolio, set up exclusively to serve as a mitigant during periods of stress.  \nAsset Encumbrance \nEncumbered assets primarily comprise those on- and off-balance sheet assets that are pledged as collateral against \nsecured funding, collateral swaps, and other collateralized obligations. Generally, loans are encumbered to support long-\nterm capital markets secured issuance such as covered bonds or other self-securitization structures, while financing debt \nand equity inventory on a secured basis is a regular activity for the Investment Bank business. Additionally, in line with the \nEuropean Banking Authority technical standards on regulatory asset encumbrance reporting, assets pledged with \nsettlement systems (including default funds and initial margins) as well as other assets pledged which cannot be freely \nwithdrawn such as mandatory minimum reserves at central banks are considered encumbered assets. Derivative margin \nreceivable assets as encumbered under these European Banking Authority guidelines are also included. \nFunds transfer pricing \nFTP is a cost allocation and business steering tool to manage costs and benefits (remuneration) associated with funding \nand contingent liquidity risk, aligned to firm’s risk appetite. FTP applies to all Corporate Divisions and entities with balance \nsheet items requiring active management and funding from the Group and promotes pricing of (i) assets in accordance \nwith their underlying liquidity risk, (ii) liabilities in accordance with their liquidity value and (iii) contingent liquidity \nexposures in accordance with the cost of providing for appropriate High Quality Liquid Assets. \nWithin this framework funding and liquidity risk costs and benefits are allocated to the Group’s business units based on \nrates which reflect the economic costs of liquidity for Deutsche Bank. Treasury might set further financial incentives in line \nwith the Group’s liquidity risk guidelines. \nAdditional details are included in Note 4 “Business segments and related information“ of the consolidated financial \nstatements. \nContingency Funding Planning \nDeutsche Bank’s Group Contingency Funding Plan outlines how Deutsche Bank would respond to an actual or anticipated \nliquidity stress event.

Strategic risk arises from the \nexposure of the bank to the macroeconomic environment, changes in the competitive landscape, and regulatory and \ntechnological developments. Additionally, it could occur due to errors in strategic positioning, the bank’s failure to execute \nits planned strategy and/or a failure to effectively address underperformance versus plan targets. \nThe strategic plan is developed annually and presented to the Management Board for discussion and approval. The final \nplan is presented to the Supervisory Board. The plan is challenged in an iterative process with respect to its assumptions, \ncredibility and integrity. During the year, execution of business strategies is regularly monitored to assess the performance \nagainst targets. A more comprehensive description of this process is detailed in the section ‘Strategic and Capital Plan’. \nStrategic risk is measured through a dedicated risk model that quantifies potential losses caused by unexpected pre-tax \nearnings shortfalls that cannot be offset by cost reductions under extreme but plausible market conditions over a 12-\nmonth period. Strategic risk appetite is also established for the Group via dedicated metrics. \nEnterprise Risk Management is the independent risk control function for Strategic Risk. A framework that includes setting \nrisk appetite and monitoring adherence has been implemented in line with the control standards the Enterprise Risk \nManagement function set.  \nCapital risk \nCapital risk is defined as the risk that Deutsche Bank has an insufficient level or composition of capital supply to support \nits current and planned business activities and associated risks during normal and stressed conditions. ERM considers \navailable capital resources when setting the bank’s overarching risk appetite and cascade to Business Divisions.  \nThe Group’s capital risk framework consists of several elements which aim to ensure that Deutsche Bank maintains on an \nongoing basis an adequate capitalization to cover the risks to which is exposed. The framework is strongly integrated with \nthe bank-wide strategic planning process and closely linked to Deutsche Bank’s internal capital adequacy assessment \nprocess (see section “Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process” for further details). Treasury together with the \ndivisions is the key risk manager of the associated risks and represents the 1st LoD. Treasury Risk Management (TRM) acts \nas the 2nd LoD for capital risk. \nThe Treasury function manages capital risk at group level and locally in each region, as applicable. This includes managing \nissuances and repurchases of capital instruments (see section on “Capital management” for details). Additionally, divisional \nlimits for key capital resources are approved by the Group Asset and Liability Committee to ensure alignment with the \ncapital risk appetite (see section on “Resource limit setting” for details). \nTRM sets the capital risk framework, assesses the capital risk profile and provides independent challenge. This includes \nsetting of risk appetite thresholds for key capital ratios. Threshold breaches are subject to a dedicated governance \nframework triggering management actions up to the execution of Deutsche Bank’s recovery plan. Thresholds also provide \nboundaries to the capital plan and are fully integrated into the regular assessment of capital risk under stress scenarios. \n \n \n"}

They occur \nwithin and across counterparties, businesses, regions/countries, industries and products. The management and monitoring \nof risk concentrations is achieved through a quantitative and qualitative approach, as follows: \n– Intra-risk concentrations are assessed, monitored and mitigated by the individual risk functions (enterprise, credit, \nmarket, operational and liquidity risk management). This is supported by risk appetite including limit setting on different \nlevels and/or management according to each risk type \n– Inter-risk concentrations are managed through quantitative top-down stress-testing and qualitative bottom-up \nreviews, identifying and assessing risk themes independent of any risk type and providing a holistic view across the bank. \nThe diversification effects between credit, market, operational and strategic risk are measured through a dedicated risk \nmodel that quantifies the diversification benefit caused by non-perfect correlations between these risk types. The \ncalculation of the risk type diversification benefit is intended to ensure that the standalone economic capital figures for \nthe individual risk types are aggregated in an economically meaningful way \nThe most senior governance body for the oversight of risk concentrations is the Group Risk Committee (GRC). \nEnvironmental, social and governance risk \nThe impacts of rising global average temperatures, the enhanced focus on climate change and the transition to a net-zero \neconomy from society, regulators and the banking sector have led to the emergence of new and increasing sources of \nfinancial and non-financial risks. These include the physical risks arising from extreme weather events growing in frequency \nand severity, as well as transition risks as carbon intensive sectors are expected to face higher taxation, reduced demand \nand restricted access to financing. These risks can impact Deutsche Bank across a broad range of financial and non-\nfinancial risk types. Financial institutions are also facing increased scrutiny on climate and broader ESG-related issues from \ngovernments, regulators, shareholders and other bodies, leading to reputational risks if the Group is not seen to support \nthe transition to a lower carbon economy, to protect biodiversity and human rights, among other themes. \nDeutsche Bank’s risk strategy recognizes ESG as a theme that represents a broad range of areas of concern related to \nenvironmental, social, or governance factors that cuts across multiple scenarios or risks. It must be ensured that all non-\nfinancial ESG-related risks are identified and adequately assessed to include potential impacts driven by ESG factors; the \nbank must also ensure that controls are effective and any potential deficiencies are promptly escalated and addressed. \nDeutsche Bank is regularly reviewing and enhancing its ESG risk management frameworks in alignment with regulatory \nguidance and to ensure that ESG risks are actively managed and greenwashing risk is mitigated. Limitations in terms data, \nmethodologies and industry standards for measuring and assessing climate and other environmental risks continue to lead \nto a higher degree of uncertainty into climate-related disclosures. Anti-ESG measures that were already established in \nsome jurisdictions are now reinforced and taken further may result in the loss of existing business and the inability to \nconduct new business within those jurisdictions, while complying may lead to reputational risks. \nThe management of risks stemming from environmental factors relies first and foremost with Deutsche Bank’s net zero-\naligned decarbonization targets for eight sectors: Oil and Gas (upstream), Power Generation, Automotive (light duty \nvehicles), Steel, Coal mining, Cement, Shipping and Commercial Aviation. The pathways to achieve these targets are \nincorporated into the bank’s risk management framework. Environmental risks are assessed through an annual climate and \nenvironmental materiality assessment and internal stress test, across businesses, portfolios and risk types (Credit, Market, \nLiquidity, Reputational and Operational); They are monitored through dedicated reports discussed in senior risk \ncommittees and managed through risk appetite thresholds, policies requirements and exclusions (Environmental and \nSocial policy framework), and portfolio Early Warning Indicators (EWIs). Climate and environmental risks are incorporated \ninto the credit approval process for corporate clients via enhanced due diligence requirements. New loan requests above \nselected tenor and rating-based thresholds to corporate clients in carbon-intensive sectors as well as those in sectors \nvulnerable to climate-physical and nature (or “other environmental”) risks require a dedicated risk assessment from the \nFront Office and review by Credit Risk Management. Overall, these risks are embedded within the bank’s business model \nand financial planning through the carbon budgets attributed to the bank’s businesses derived from its decarbonization \ntargets and through the inclusion of environmental risks within the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).  \n \n \n"}

The Group Chief Security Officer \n(CSO) has delegated authority from the Management Board, including approval of the security policies and the security \nstrategy for the Deutsche Bank Group. The CSO reports directly to the Chief Technology, Data, and Innovation Officer, \nwho is a member of the Management Board. The Management Board is accountable for the implementation of the \ninformation security framework, with oversight from the Supervisory Board. There are multiple mechanisms in place for \nthe CSO to escalate security issues directly to the Management Board if required.  \nDeutsche Bank’s CSO has served in various roles in information security for more than 20 years. This includes roles as global \nChief Information Security Officer (CISO)/Chief Security Officer (CSO) for three different large European financial \ninstitutions and a partner position in a global strategy and consulting firm, leading security work for financial service clients. \nThe Group Chief Security Officer is supported by security role holders at various seniority levels across the bank to ensure \nthat security requirements are met from a regional, divisional, and technical perspective. All information security activities \nare overseen by two dedicated governance forums chaired by the CSO: the Group IT Security Council (interface to the \nbank’s IT units), and the Group Information Security Committee (interface to the bank’s business and infrastructure \ndivisions). The independent Risk Management function for Information Security is represented in both forums. Both forums \nprovide advice on the security strategy and oversee the progress and performance of key information security deliverables, \nthe remediation status of information security related audit findings and information security incidents as well as the \ninformation security posture of Deutsche Bank Group against defined targets. In the event of critical issues, members are \nassigned specific actions according to their responsibility.  \nSecurity indicators and reporting provided to the bank’s relevant governance forums support appropriate security risk \nawareness and decision taking. The comprehensive metrics framework maintained by the Chief Security Office is \nunderpinned by an extensive data set allowing for various dedicated views. The Management Board receives a quarterly \ninformation security risk posture report, as well as ad hoc information if required. Furthermore, the CSO provides regular \nupdates on material topics relating to security to the Supervisory Board’s Committee responsible for Technology, Data \nand Innovation. \n"}

The security \nstrategy, which is reviewed on a regular basis, incorporates developments in the threat landscape, technology, the \nregulatory environment, the bank’s corporate and IT strategy, and other internal and external parameters. The approach \nprovides comprehensive and layered security controls. The Chief Security Office works closely with the bank´s divisions to \nenable alignment with the security by design approach throughout bank wide programs and initiatives. Security \ninvestments are prioritized and adjusted by a threat-driven perspective, leveraging the regular review and assessment of \nthe maturity of the bank’s security implementation.  \nA key element of the bank’s security strategy is to foster responsibility and active awareness among Deutsche Bank staff. \nBy embedding these principles into daily practices, Deutsche Bank aims to bring about long-term behavioral changes that \nhelp mitigate risks and enhance overall security. The bank’s security culture and awareness campaign, “Mission Security”, \ncommunicated to all employees worldwide, reinforces these efforts. Another way the bank strengthens security culture is \nby periodically conducting simulations and testing exercises, including phishing simulation and mandatory training. \nImpact, risk, and opportunity management \nImpacts, risks, and opportunities \nClients expect secure access to their bank’s services anytime, anywhere, and through a variety of channels. As part of doing \nbusiness with the bank, clients entrust Deutsche Bank with sensitive data. Deutsche Bank has the responsibility to preserve \nthe confidentiality, integrity, and availability of clients’, as well as business partners’ data and of its own information assets, \nincluding the bank’s employees’ information. Doing so consistently and effectively is essential for retaining the trust of \nthese stakeholders and preserving their interests. Consequently, the bank continues to invest in security risk mitigation. \nBased on stringent risk management processes, Deutsche Bank adjusts its security capabilities to safeguard its ability to \nprovide products and services to clients and protect the continued operations of the bank’s businesses. Stable and resilient \nservices support stakeholder trust, help grow business and revenue opportunities and protect brand value. \nIncreasing frequency and complexity of recent cyberattacks has resulted in an elevated risk profile for many organizations \naround the world, including Deutsche Bank. The bank continuously monitors the security threat landscape and vigilantly \nobserves technological developments, the geopolitical landscape and economic impacts driving security risks, assessing \ntheir relevance for potential impacts. Sophisticated and often financially motivated cyberattacks, including ransomware, \ncan be observed as persistent threats across industries and are expected to become even more frequent. Additional threats \nare posed by supply chain attacks, a growing number of critical software vulnerabilities potentially exploited by threat \nactors (zero-day exploits), and an increased threat surface introduced by, for example, remote ways of working.  \n2024 focus areas continued to include supply chain risk and common attack scenarios like Ransomware or Denial of \nService, as well as emerging risks such as Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing. Ongoing geopolitical unrest \ncontinues to drive cyber-attack activity across various threat actor types. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are \ngrowing in occurrence, frequency, and intensity.  \nTechnological advancements pose demands on data privacy and security. As the use of artificial intelligence becomes \nwidespread, there are also increased risks to cybersecurity, such as the criminal use of deepfakes, and more sophisticated \nsocial engineering attacks.  \nThird-party software or technology solution providers will continue to be a key target for threat actors, who see such \nsupply chain attacks as means to compromise or disrupt a larger number of downstream customers and assets, amplifying \nthe impact of their attacks.  \nFailure to embed and ensure oversight of security requirements into the bank’s framework to best address associated risks \nand subsequent appropriate implementation can lead to breaches of confidentiality and integrity of information, and \nunavailability of information and/or services. Additionally, Deutsche Bank may face operational risks arising from failures \nin the control environment, including errors in the performance of processes or security controls, as well as loss of data, \nwhich may disrupt business and lead to material losses.  \n \n \n"}

This encompasses internal and third-parties information technology systems.  \nA successful cyberattack could have a significant negative direct or indirect impact on the bank that may result in the \ndisclosure or misuse of client, as well as proprietary information, damage to or inability to access information technology \nsystems, statutory or regulatory non-compliance and financial losses. Potential consequences range from reputational \ndamage and client dissatisfaction via contractual non-compliance (e.g., if services are not provided as agreed) to \nremediation costs (such as for investigation and reestablishing services), increased cybersecurity costs (such as for \nadditional personnel, technology, or third-party vendors), and potential penalties and fines, to personal data breach \nnotification obligations, and litigation exposure. \nDeutsche Bank maintains insurance as an additional risk mitigant for cyber risk. The bank´s insurance coverage is designed \nto include mitigation of the financial impact of security incidents, it may however not fully cover all potential losses, \nincluding reputational damage or indirect costs associated with a cyber event.  Notwithstanding the bank’s security \nmeasures, there can be no assurance that its policies, controls, or cyber insurance coverage will be sufficient to prevent or \nfully mitigate the impact of future cyber incidents and it could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. \nPolicies and risk management \nThe bank’s policies and controls support risk reduction and mitigation for potential negative impacts. Information Security \nRisk is managed as an Operational Risk under the Non-Financial Risk Management Framework of the bank. The Chief \nSecurity Office is responsible for and executes security matters against the Non-Financial Risk Management Framework \nand leverages the results of its various instruments whereas Non-Financial Risk Management provides oversight, review, \nand challenge. Measures for the further reduction of material residual risks may include policy changes or policy \namendments at divisional or group level as well as prioritized investment and accelerated implementation of risk mitigating \nactivities.  \nSecurity risks are assessed on a continual basis, through analysis of internal and external events, events at peer institutions, \nmonitoring of the threat environment, and discussion in various forums. The annual risk and control assessment process \nevaluates risk scenarios such as service disruption, system misuse, data distortion, asset or data destruction, data \ndisclosure, financial theft and non-adherence or non-conduct to regulatory policies and laws. It leverages industry \nstandard threat assessment frameworks, such as MITRE, and provides the foundation for the assessment of financial \nindustry relevant risk scenarios.  \nThe thorough analysis comprises potentially affected stakeholders, including clients and suppliers, as well as the external \nthreat landscape. The process considers contextual data and controls such as major events, threat assessments, findings, \nscenario analysis, control metrics, lessons learned, events at peer institutions, read across, regulatory expectations and \nremediation activities, when assessing control suites and residual risk positions. In case of emerging developments, \nadditional risk reviews are conducted. The results are evaluated against the bank's control capabilities to cope with these \nrisks.  \nAs part of the annual risk and control assessment process, internal security subject matter experts provide a risk evaluation, \nsupported by other areas such as Legal, Compliance or Group Data Privacy, as necessary. That evaluation is reviewed and \nchallenged by risk subject matter experts to arrive at a final residual risk position. Additionally, senior information security \nexperts from all divisions and functions assess the exposure of the group, based on their divisional or functional \nbackground. Those divisional and functional assessments are also reviewed and challenged by risk subject matter experts \nto arrive at a final residual risk position for divisions and functions.  \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 151, "text": " \n \n119  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisk and Capital Management \nAnnual Report 2024 \nInformation security \nA comprehensive information security management system (ISMS) is crucial for an organization handling vast amounts of \nfinancial assets and sensitive data. In alignment with its Non-Financial Risk Management policies, Deutsche Bank’s globally \napplicable security policy framework defines the core principles of and the fundamentals for security management. The \npolicy framework is reviewed annually, and any changes are approved by the CSO. It is governed centrally and applied \nglobally across all product groups and business and infrastructure divisions. It also defines the roles, responsibilities, and \naccountabilities of key personnel identified to manage information security risk. The framework is aligned with the security \nstrategy and sets out measures to manage and resolve information security breaches, and related communication \nprocedures.  \nThe bank’s ISMS has been certified by an accredited certification body according to ISO 27001, for all information security \ndomains defined within that standard since 2012. To maintain the ISO 27001 certification, the bank performs a full \nrecertification process every three years, with the latest taking place in 2024. With the last recertification, Deutsche Bank \nupgraded its ISMS to the 2022 version of ISO 27001. Furthermore, the bank performs an annual surveillance audit designed \nto ensure compliance between the certification intervals.  \nDependency on third-party products and services can expose the bank to cyber risks and impact its risk posture, as these \ncan be prime targets for information security attacks. Third-party information security risks are managed by Deutsche Bank \nthrough a combination of capabilities, implementing a comprehensive approach to mitigate these risks and cover \nregulatory requirements (incl. the EU DORA regulation). Key components include the bank’s global third-party risk \nmanagement program, which is designed to identify, monitor, and mitigate risks associated with third-party engagements. \nIn combination, the bank demands adherence to an information security policy with specific control objectives for third \nparties, which include incident notification requirements. To ensure adherence, the information security posture of the \nthird parties is reevaluated on a periodic basis (defined by the criticality of the vendor). In response to specific threats and \nincidents, proactive engagement and outreach with these parties is taking place. This is complemented by security \nassessments, which also include onsite assessments of third parties. These measures collectively contribute to the bank’s \noversight and support that third-party services align with the bank’s security requirements. \nFor more details on the bank’s Third-Party Management, please refer to the Supply Chain Management chapter in the \nSustainability Statement. \nActions and resources \nTo address the evolving threat landscape, Deutsche Bank has a variety of prevention methods and controls in place. These \ninclude, for example, network security, identity and access management, endpoint and data security (including data \nclassification and leakage prevention), threat intelligence, cyber hygiene, and encryption solutions. Those preventive \ncontrols are backed by a threat-driven detection set-up and a robust incident-response process.  \nThe bank continually reviews and enhances its information security controls through multiple layers of technology, \nincluding databases, infrastructure, devices, and applications. This is complemented by organizational controls and \nsecurity training and awareness. The purpose of this layered approach is to strengthen the end-to-end protection by \nutilizing multiple opportunities to detect, prevent, respond to, and recover from cyber threats.  \nDeutsche Bank employs various mechanisms to self-identify areas for improvements and control enhancements. These \ninclude security testing, security problem management and lessons learned. Deutsche Bank´s independent Group Audit \nfunction is mandated to regularly assess security controls as part of their audit plan. Furthermore, the regular annual audit \nconducted by the bank´s external auditor considers identity and access management controls. The overall information \nsecurity program of the bank is evaluated on a regular basis by third-party organizations.  \nThe bank actively shares security best practices and threat information with national and international security \norganizations, government authorities, and peer organizations. These relationships help ensure that the bank’s security \ntechnology and procedures reflect current financial industry’s best practices and keep pace with the threat environment.  \nAs digitalization advances, the need to enhance literacy on information security topics grows. Deutsche Bank addresses \nthis by educating and informing clients through informational materials and client events, highlighting information security \nthreats and the bank's protective measures. This also includes response to client inquiries on information security topics \nthrough its client relationship function.  \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 152, "text": " \n \n120  \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisk and Capital Management \nAnnual Report 2024 \nInformation security \nDeutsche Bank also requires a yearly mandatory information security baseline training for all employees and eligible \ncontractor staff. This training encompasses the content of the information security policy, the process to report security \nincidents or any other security-related concerns, as well as important and current security threats. To address the latter \nand to comply with internal standards, the training is updated at least on a yearly basis. For Deutsche Bank employees, \nfailure to complete this training and late completion can result in disciplinary consequences. In 2024, a learning completion \nrate of 99,65% was achieved for the e-Learning-based mandatory information security training, compared to 99,94% in \n2023.  \nDeutsche Bank’s security incident management covers on a day-to-day-basis security events that may affect the bank, its \nclients and business partners, or employees. The Cyber Threat Operations Centers located in Asia Pacific, Europe and USA \nsupport global and group-wide detection of threats and response to incidents 24/7. The related management and \nreporting processes performed with involvement of subject matter experts, such as divisional Chief Information Security \nOfficers, Compliance, Legal, Group Communications and Group Data Privacy, are designed to enable a quick and effective \nresponse to cyberattacks and information security threats. The objective is to minimize the risk of impacts on Deutsche \nBank and to use insights gained from incident handling to continuously improve the bank’s processes.  \nAs in prior years, Deutsche Bank in 2024 experienced attacks on computer systems, including attacks aimed at obtaining \nunauthorized access to confidential company or client information, damaging, or interfering with company data, resources, \nor business activities, or otherwise exploiting vulnerabilities in its infrastructure, including attacks that occurred along the \nbank’s supply chain. The bank, however, did not experience any material effect on its business strategy, results of \noperation, or financial condition as the result of an information security incident, including attempted cyber-attacks.  \nConsequently, the bank continues to invest in security risk mitigation. As in previous years, in 2024 Deutsche Bank adapted \nits security capabilities through several programs across information and physical security. As examples, the bank further \nstrengthened its perimeter security and expanded its comprehensive staff security training offering, including the launch \nof a security academy. \n"}

Tier 1 \ncapital is subdivided into Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital. \nCET 1 capital consists primarily of common share capital (net of own holdings) including related share premium accounts, \nretained earnings (including losses for the financial year, if any) and accumulated other comprehensive income, subject to \nprudential filters and regulatory adjustments as well as minority interests qualifying for inclusion in consolidated CET 1 \ncapital. Prudential filters for CET 1 capital, according to Articles 32 to 35 CRR, include securitization gains on sale, cash \nflow hedges and changes in the value of own liabilities, and additional value adjustments. CET 1 capital regulatory \nadjustments for instance includes intangible assets (exceeding their prudential value), adoption of the temporary \ntreatment of unrealized gains and losses measured at fair value through OCI in accordance with Article 468 CRR which \napplies until year-end 2025, deferred tax assets that rely on future profitability, negative amounts resulting from the \ncalculation of expected loss amounts, net defined benefit pension fund assets, reciprocal cross holdings in the capital of \nfinancial sector entities and, significant and non-significant investments in the capital (CET 1, AT1, Tier 2) of financial \nsector entities above certain thresholds. All items which are not deducted (i.e., amounts below the threshold) are subject \nto risk-weighting.  \nAdditional Tier 1 capital consists of AT1 capital instruments and related share premium accounts as well as noncontrolling \ninterests qualifying for inclusion in consolidated AT1 capital. To qualify as AT1 capital under CRR/CRD, instruments must \nhave principal loss absorption through a conversion to common shares or a write-down mechanism allocating losses at a \ntrigger point and must also meet further requirements such as perpetual with no incentive to redeem and institution must \nhave full dividend/coupon discretion at all times. \nTier 2 capital comprises eligible capital instruments, the related share premium accounts and subordinated long-term \ndebt, certain loan loss provisions and noncontrolling interests that qualify for inclusion in consolidated Tier 2 capital. To \nqualify as Tier 2 capital, capital instruments or subordinated debt must have an original maturity of at least five years. \nMoreover, eligible capital instruments may inter alia not contain an incentive to redeem, a right of investors to accelerate \nrepayment, or a credit sensitive dividend feature. \n"}

The Pillar 1 total capital \nrequirement of 8.00% demands further resources that may be met with up to 1.50% Additional Tier 1 capital and up to \n2.00% Tier 2 capital. \nFailure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in supervisory measures such as restrictions of profit distributions \nor limitations on certain businesses such as lending. Deutsche Bank complied with the minimum regulatory capital \nadequacy requirements in 2024. \nIn addition to these minimum capital requirements, the following combined capital buffer requirements were fully \neffective beginning 2024 onwards. These buffer requirements must be met in addition to the Pillar 1 minimum capital \nrequirements but can be drawn down in times of economic stress. \nThe capital conservation buffer is implemented in Section 10c German Banking Act, based on Article 129 CRD and equals \na requirement of 2.50% CET 1 capital of RWA. \nThe countercyclical capital buffer is deployed in a jurisdiction when excess credit growth is associated with an increase in \nsystem-wide risk. It may vary between 0% and 2.50% CET 1 capital of RWA. In exceptional cases, it could also be higher \nthan 2.50%. The institution-specific countercyclical buffer that applies to Deutsche Bank is the weighted average of the \ncountercyclical capital buffers that apply in the jurisdictions where relevant credit exposures are located. As per December \n31, 2024, the institution-specific countercyclical capital buffer was at 0.49%. \nIn addition to the aforementioned buffers, national authorities, such as the BaFin, may require a systemic risk buffer to \nprevent and mitigate long-term non-cyclical systemic or macro-prudential risks that are not covered by the CRR. They can \nrequire an additional buffer of up to 5.00% CET 1 capital of RWA. As of the year end 2024, the systemic risk buffer applied \nto Deutsche Bank is 0.22%.  \nDeutsche Bank continues to be designated as a global systemically important institution (G-SII) by the BaFin in agreement \nwith the Deutsche Bundesbank, resulting in a G-SII buffer requirement of 1.50% CET 1 capital of RWA in 2024 based on \nthe indicators as published in 2020. This assessment has been confirmed by the FSB in 2024. Further, BaFin has announced \nthat the G-SII buffer requirement for Deutsche Bank will remain unchanged for the years 2025 and 2026. \nAdditionally, Deutsche Bank has been classified by BaFin in agreement with the Deutsche Bundesbank as an “other \nsystemically important institution” (O-SII) with an additional capital buffer requirement of 2.00% in 2023 that has to be \nmet on a consolidated level and remained unchanged for 2024 and 2025. The higher of the buffers for systemically \nimportant institutions (G-SII buffer or O-SII buffer) must be applied.  \nPursuant to the Pillar 2 SREP, the ECB may impose capital requirements on individual banks which are more stringent than \nstatutory requirements (so-called Pillar 2 requirement).  \nIn December 2023, the ECB informed Deutsche Bank of its decision effective January 1, 2024, that the bank’s Pillar 2 \nrequirement changed compared to 2023. This results in ECB’s Pillar 2 requirement to 2.65% of RWA. As of December 31, \n2024, Deutsche Bank needs to maintain on a consolidated basis a CET 1 ratio of at least 11.20%, a Tier 1 ratio of at least \n13.20% and a Total Capital ratio of at least 15.86%. The CET 1 requirement comprises the Pillar 1 minimum capital \nrequirement of 4.50%, the Pillar 2 requirement (SREP add-on) of 1.49%, the capital conservation buffer of 2.50%, the \ncountercyclical buffer of 0.49% and the systemic risk buffer of 0.22% (both subject to changes throughout the year) as well \nas the higher of our G-SII/O-SII buffer of 2.00%. Correspondingly, the Tier 1 capital requirement includes additionally a Tier \n1 minimum capital requirement of 1.50% plus a Pillar 2 requirement of 0.50%, and the Total Capital requirement includes \nfurther a Tier 2 minimum capital requirement of 2.00% and a Pillar 2 requirement of 0.66%. Also, following the results of \nthe 2023 SREP, the ECB communicated to Deutsche Bank an individual expectation to hold a further Pillar 2 CET 1 capital \nadd-on, commonly referred to as the Pillar 2 guidance. The capital add-on pursuant to the Pillar 2 guidance is separate \nfrom and in addition to the Pillar 2 requirement. The ECB has stated that it expects banks to meet the Pillar 2 guidance \nalthough it is not legally binding, and failure to meet the Pillar 2 guidance does not lead to automatic restrictions of capital \ndistributions.  \nOn December 10, 2024, Deutsche Bank was informed by the ECB of its decision regarding prudential minimum capital \nrequirements for 2025 that applies from January 1, 2025, onwards, following the results of the 2024 SREP. The decision \nset ECB’s Pillar 2 requirement to 2.90% of RWA, effective as of January 1, 2025, of which at least 1.63% must be covered \nby CET 1 capital and 2.18% by Tier 1 capital.  \n"}

This development included a net profit of € 3.4 billion for the year \n2024 reduced by regulatory deductions for future shareholder distribution and AT1 coupon payments of € 2.6 billion \nwhich is in line with the ECB Decision (EU) (2015/656) on the recognition of interim or year-end profits in CET 1 capital in \naccordance with the Article 26(2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (ECB/2015/4). In addition, CET 1 capital increased due \nto adoption of the temporary treatment of unrealized gains and losses measured at fair value through OCI in accordance \nwith Article 468 CRR by € 1.0 billion, lower deferred tax assets of € 0.7 billion and a reduction in prudential filters of \n€ 0.3 billion which includes additional value adjustments as well as gains and losses arising due to changes in own credit \nrisk on fair valued liabilities. The increase was partially offset by completed share buybacks of € 0.7 billion during the year \nand an increase in deduction for expected loss shortfall by € 0.7 billion which is mainly due to amended Internal Ratings-\nBased Approach models following model approval by ECB. \nThe AT1 capital increase of € 3.1 billion was mainly due to the issuance of two new AT1 capital instruments during the year \namounting to € 1.5 billion each. \nThe Tier 2 capital decrease of € 0.9 billion was mainly due to amortization of € 1.0 billion and € 0.4 billion in carrying \namount change arising from accrued interest and fair value hedge. This was partially offset by € 0.4 billion due to foreign \nexchange effects. \n"}

This regulation results in a Pillar 1 deduction from \nCET 1 capital when a minimum loss coverage requirement is not met. It is applied to exposures originated and defaulted \nafter April 25, 2019.  \nIn addition, in March 2018, the ECB published its “Addendum to the ECB Guidance to banks on non-performing loans: \nsupervisory expectations for prudential provisioning of non-performing exposures” and in August 2019, its \n“Communication on supervisory coverage expectations for NPEs”.  \nThe ECB guidance issued is applicable to all newly defaulted loans after April 1, 2018 (ECB - new NPE’s after April 1, 2018) \nand, similar to the EU rules, it requires banks to take measures in case a minimum impairment coverage requirement is not \nmet. Within the annual SREP discussions ECB may impose Pillar 2 measures on banks in case ECB is not confident with \nmeasure taken by the individual bank. \nFor the year end 2020, the bank introduced a framework to determine the prudential provisioning of non-performing \nexposure as a Pillar 2 measure as requested in the before mentioned ECB’s guidance and SREP recommendation.  \nFor the minimum loss coverage expectation for NPE´s arising from clients defaulted before April 1, 2018 (ECB – NPE Stock) \na phase-in path to 100% coverage expectation was envisaged with an annual increase of 10%. In a first step, banks were \nallocated to three comparable groups on the basis of the bank’s net NPL ratios as of end-2017 and in a second step an \nassessment of capacity regarding the potential impact was carried out for each individual bank with a horizon of end-2026. \nDeutsche Bank has been assigned to Group 1 which requires a full applicability of 100% minimum loss coverage by year \nend 2024 for secured loans respectively by year end 2023 for unsecured loans. \nThe shortfall between the minimum loss coverage requirements for non-performing exposure and the risk reserves \nrecorded in line with the IFRS 9 for defaulted (Stage 3) assets amounted to € 302 million as of December 31, 2024 and was \ndeducted from CET 1.

The \nincrease of € 7.7 billion was driven by credit risk RWA and operational risk RWA, partially offset by market risk RWA and \ncredit valuation adjustment RWA. Credit risk RWA increased by € 11.2 billion, primarily driven by business growth, \nrefinements of internal models, foreign exchange movements, increased equity positions in guaranteed funds and higher \nRWA for deferred tax assets. These increases were partially offset by credit risk RWA reductions from capital efficiency \nmeasures especially within the Corporate Bank and the Investment Bank. Deutsche Bank´s operational risk RWA increased \nby € 0.9 billion, mainly driven by increased internal losses as well as the adverse development of external losses feeding \ninto the capital model. Market risk RWA decreased by € 2.5 billion, primarily driven by Value-at-Risk component due to \noverall lower market volatility and reduced risk levels, which also resulted in a reduction of the Stressed-Value-at-Risk \n(SVaR) and the incremental risk charge components. Credit valuation adjustment RWA decreased by € 1.8 billion, mainly \ndriven by a movement in risk levels and a reduction from market data changes. \nThe tables below provide an analysis of key drivers for risk-weighted asset movements observed for credit risk, credit \nvaluation adjustments as well as market and operational risk in the reporting period.

The category \n“book quality” mainly represents the effects from portfolio rating migrations, loss given default, model parameter \nrecalibrations as well as collateral and netting coverage activities. “Model updates” include model refinements and \nadvanced model roll out. RWA movements resulting from externally, regulatory-driven changes, e.g., applying new \nregulations, are considered in the “methodology and policy” section. “Acquisition and disposals” shows significant \nexposure movements which can be clearly assigned to new businesses or disposal-related activities. Changes that cannot \nbe attributed to the above categories are reflected in the category “other”. \nRWA for credit risk increased by € 11.2 billion, or 4.2%, since December 31, 2023, which is mainly driven by the categories \n“foreign exchange movements”, “book size”, “model updates”, “methodology and policy” as well as “other” and was partly \noffset by category “book quality”. The increase in category “book size” is reflecting Deutsche Bank´s business growth in \n2024 and increased equity shares in guaranteed funds, partly offset by capital efficiency measures in the form of synthetic \nsecuritizations in the Corporate Bank, the Private Bank and the Investment Bank. Furthermore, credit risk RWA increased \nin the category “model updates” compared to 2023, mainly driven by a refinement of internal model for loss given default \ncalculation and a margin of conservatism applied on a key model input. The category “methodology and policy” mainly \nreflects impacts from the introduction of new models due to regulatory changes, including impacts from an early adoption \nof rules as per CRR3, which was partly offset by impacts from the remediation of regulatory obligations. Additionally, the \nincrease in category “other” reflects higher RWA for deferred tax assets and investments in financial sector entities. The \naforementioned increases were partly offset by decreases in category “book quality” which is mainly driven by RWA \nreductions from capital efficiency measures, partly offset by counterparty rating deteriorations.  \nRWA for counterparty credit risk decreased by € 0.4 billion, or 2.0%, since December 31, 2023, mainly driven by the \ndecrease in category “book size” reflecting a change in the derivative portfolio with reduced risk weights, which more than \ncompensated the increase in exposures. Additionally, exposures for SFTs decreased. These decreases were partly offset \nby increases in categories “foreign exchange movements” and “model updates” reflecting an update to the determination \nof input parameters.  \nBased on the CRR/CRD regulatory framework, Deutsche Bank is required to calculate RWA using the CVA which takes into \naccount the credit quality of our counterparties. RWA for CVA covers the risk of mark-to-market losses on the expected \ncounterparty risk in connection with OTC derivative exposures and securities financing transactions.

Starting with January 1, 2023, an \nadditional leverage ratio buffer requirement of 50% of the applicable G-SII buffer rate applies. This additional requirement \nequals 0.75% for Deutsche Bank. Furthermore, the European Central Bank has set a Pillar 2 requirement for the leverage \nratio for the first time; effective January 1, 2024, this requirement is 0.10%. This adds up to an overall leverage ratio \nrequirement of 3.85%. Also, following the results of the 2023 SREP, the ECB communicated to Deutsche Bank an individual \nexpectation to hold a further Pillar 2 Tier 1 capital add-on in relation to the leverage ratio, commonly referred to as the \nPillar 2 guidance. The capital add-on pursuant to the Pillar 2 guidance is separate from and in addition to the Pillar 2 \nrequirement. The ECB has stated that it expects banks to meet the Pillar 2 guidance although it is not legally binding, and \nfailure to meet the Pillar 2 guidance does not lead to automatic restrictions of capital distributions. \nDeutsche Bank calculates its leverage ratio exposure in accordance with Articles 429 to 429g of the CRR. \nThe Group’s total leverage ratio exposure includes derivatives, securities financing transactions (SFTs), off-balance sheet \nexposure and other on-balance sheet exposure (excluding derivatives and SFTs). \nThe leverage exposure for derivatives is calculated by using a modified version of the standardized approach for \ncounterparty credit risk (SA-CCR), comprising the current replacement cost plus a regulatory defined add-on for the \npotential future exposure. The effective notional amount of written credit derivatives, i.e., the notional reduced by any \nnegative fair value changes that have been incorporated in Tier 1 capital is included in the leverage ratio exposure measure; \nthe resulting exposure measure is further reduced by the effective notional amount of purchased credit derivative \nprotection on the same reference name provided certain conditions are met. \nThe SFT component includes the gross receivables for SFTs, which are netted with SFT payables if specific conditions are \nmet. In addition to the gross exposure a regulatory add-on for the counterparty credit risk is included.  \nThe off-balance sheet exposure component follows the standardized approach for credit risk with credit risk conversion \nfactors (CCF) depending on the risk category (0% for low risk, 20% for medium/low risk, 50% for medium risk, or 100% for \nfull risk). For the determination of the leverage exposure a floor of 10% is applied leading to a 10% CCF for the low risk \ncategory. \nThe on-balance sheet exposures (excluding derivatives and SFTs) component reflects the accounting values of the assets \n(excluding derivatives, SFTs and regular-way purchases and sales awaiting settlement). The exposure value of regular-way \npurchases and sales awaiting settlement is determined as offset between those cash receivables and cash payables where \nthe related regular-way sales and purchases are both settled on a delivery-versus payment basis. \nAssets can be excluded from the leverage ratio exposure measure if they have been deducted in the determination of Tier \n1 capital. The corresponding regulatory adjustments are reflected in the asset amounts deducted in determining Tier 1 \ncapital component. \n"}

In addition, off-\nbalance sheet leverage exposures increased by € 30.7 billion corresponding to higher notional amounts for irrevocable \nlending commitments and financial guarantees, including impacts from early adoption of rules for commitments as per \nArticle 5 (10) CRR3. Furthermore, the leverage exposure related to derivatives increased by € 5.6 billion. Asset amounts \ndeducted in determining Tier 1 capital increased by € 0.9 billion mainly driven by the temporary treatment of unrealized \ngains and losses measured at fair value through OCI in accordance with Article 468 CRR which applies until year-end 2025. \nThese increases were partly offset by the leverage exposure for the asset items not related to derivatives and SFTs (other \nassets) which decreased by € 14.3 billion largely reflecting the development of the balance sheet: the decrease in cash \nand central bank/interbank balances of € 31.0 billion was partly offset by increases in non-derivative trading assets by \n€ 5.9 billion, loans by € 4.1 billion and in receivables from unsettled regular way trades by € 4.1 billion on a net basis; \nremaining asset items not outlined separately increased by € 2.6 billion. \nThe development of the leverage exposure in 2024 includes a positive foreign exchange impact of € 32.4 billion mainly \ndue to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar versus the Euro.

In the case of Deutsche Bank AG, MREL is \ndetermined by the Single Resolution Board. While there is no statutory minimum level of MREL, the SRMR, BRRD and a \ndelegated regulation set out criteria which the resolution authority must consider when determining the relevant required \nlevel of MREL. Guidance is provided through an MREL policy published annually by the SRB. Any binding MREL ratio \ndetermined by the SRB is communicated to Deutsche Bank via the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). \nAs a result of its regular annual review the SRB has updated Deutsche Bank AG’s binding MREL ratio requirements in the \nsecond quarter of 2024 applicable immediately. The MREL ratio requirement on a consolidated basis is now 25.77% of \nRWA and 6.95% of LRE of which 19.39% of RWA and 6.95% of LRE must be met with own funds and subordinated \ninstruments.  \nThe combined buffer requirements of 5.21% as of December 31, 2024 must be met in addition to the RWA based MREL \nand subordinated MREL requirements.  \nTLAC Requirements \nSince June 27, 2019, Deutsche Bank, as a global systemically important bank, has also become subject to global minimum \nstandards for its Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC). The TLAC requirement was implemented via amendments to the \nCapital Requirements Regulation and the Capital Requirements Directive provided in June 2019 with the publication of \nRegulation (EU) 2019/876 and Directive (EU) 2019/878.  \nThis TLAC requirement is based on both risk-based and non-risk-based denominators and set at the higher-of 18% of RWA \nplus the combined buffer requirements and 6.75% of LRE since January 1, 2022. \nMREL ratio development \nAs of December 31, 2024, available MREL were € 133.9 billion, corresponding to a ratio of 37.45% of RWA and 10.17% of \nLRE. This means that Deutsche Bank has a MREL surplus of € 23.1 billion above Deutsche Bank’s MREL requirement of \n€ 110.7 billion (i.e. 30.98% of RWA including combined buffer requirement). Compared to December 31, 2023 the surplus \nhas increased as a higher MREL requirement and higher RWA were more than offset by higher MREL capacity. \n€ 118.5 billion of Deutsche Bank’s available MREL were own funds and subordinated liabilities, corresponding to a MREL \nsubordination ratio of 33.15% of RWA and 9.0% of LRE, a buffer of € 27.0 billion over Deutsche Bank’s subordination \nrequirement of € 91.5 billion (i.e. 6.95% of LRE).

Instruments eligible for MREL and TLAC are regulatory capital instruments (own funds) and liabilities that meet \ncertain criteria, which are referred to as eligible liabilities.  \nOwn funds used for MREL and TLAC include the full amount of Tier 2 capital instruments with a remaining maturity of \ngreater than 1 year and less than 5 years which are reflected in regulatory capital on a pro-rata basis only.  \nEligible liabilities are liabilities issued out of the resolution entity Deutsche Bank AG that meet eligibility criteria which are \nsupposed to ensure that they are structurally suited as loss-absorbing capital. As a result, eligible liabilities exclude \ndeposits which are covered by an insurance deposit protection scheme or which are preferred under German insolvency \nlaw (e.g., deposits from private individuals as well as small and medium-sized enterprises). Among other things, secured \nliabilities and derivatives liabilities are generally excluded as well. Debt instruments with embedded derivative features \ncan be included under certain conditions (e.g., a known and fixed or increasing principal). In addition, eligible liabilities must \nhave a remaining time to maturity of at least one year and must either be issued under the law of a Member State of the \nEuropean Union or must include a bail-in clause in their contractual terms to make write-down or conversion effective. The \nSRB has granted a transitional period for liabilities issued under UK law on or before November 15, 2018, which do not \ninclude an enforceable and effective bail-in clause but can still be included in eligible liabilities after Brexit until June 28, \n2025. \nIn addition, eligible liabilities need to be subordinated to be counted against the TLAC and MREL subordination \nrequirements. Effective January 1, 2017, the German Banking Act provided for a new class of statutorily subordinated debt \nsecurities that rank as senior non-preferred below the bank’s other senior liabilities (but in priority to the bank’s \ncontractually subordinated liabilities, such as those qualifying as Tier 2 instruments). Following a harmonization effort by \nthe European Union implemented in Germany effective July 21, 2018, banks are permitted to now decide if a specific \nissuance of eligible senior debt will be in the non-preferred or in the preferred category. Any such senior non-preferred \ndebt instruments issued by Deutsche Bank AG under such rules rank on parity with its outstanding debt instruments that \nwere classified as senior non-preferred under the prior rules. All these senior non-preferred issuances meet the TLAC and \nMREL subordination criteria. \n"}

These increases were partly offset by a decrease in cash \nand central bank balances of € 30.9 billion. \nTrading assets as of December 31, 2024, includes traded bonds of € 120.0 billion (€ 112.5 billion as of December 31, 2023) \nof which over 82% were investment-grade (over 85% as of December 31, 2023). \nCredit Enhancements are split into three categories: netting, collateral and guarantees/credit derivatives. Haircuts, \nparameter setting for regular margin calls as well as expert judgments for collateral valuation are employed to prevent \nmarket developments from leading to a build-up of uncollateralized exposures. All categories are monitored and reviewed \nregularly. Overall credit enhancements received are diversified and of adequate quality being largely cash, highly rated \ngovernment bonds and third-party guarantees mostly from well rated banks and insurance companies. These financial \ninstitutions are domiciled mainly in European countries and the United States. Furthermore, the bank has collateral pools \nof highly liquid assets and mortgages (principally consisting of residential properties mainly in Germany) for the \nhomogeneous retail portfolio. \n"}

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 178, "text": "146 \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisk and capital performance \nAnnual Report 2024 \nCredit Risk Exposure \nThe Group’s amortized cost loan exposure within above categories is mostly with borrowers of good credit quality. \nMoreover, with the focus on the Corporate Bank and Investment Bank, loan exposure is subject to further risk mitigation \nthrough the bank’s e.g., Strategic Corporate Lending unit. \nDeutsche Bank’s household loan exposure is principally associated with Private Bank portfolios. \nThe bank’s amortized cost loan exposure of € 49.9 billion to Real Estate activities as reported above is based on NACE code \nclassification and comprises of recourse and non-recourse financing, across various parts of the group and client segment. \nThis includes € 24.0 billion of loans which is based on Deutsche Bank’s definition of non-recourse CRE loans. For more \ninformation on non-recourse CRE loans, see section Focus areas. \nThe Group’s commercial real estate loans, primarily originated in the U.S. and Europe, are generally secured by first \nmortgages on the underlying real estate property. Deutsche Bank originates fixed and floating rate loans and selectively \nacquires (generally at substantial discount) sub-/non-performing loans sold by financial institutions. The underwriting \nprocess is stringent and the exposure is managed under separate portfolio limits. Credit underwriting policy guidelines \nprovide that LTV ratios of generally less than 75% are adhered to at loan origination. Additionally, given the significance of \nthe underlying collateral, independent external appraisals are commissioned for all secured loans by a valuation team (part \nof the independent Credit Risk Management function) which is also responsible for reviewing and challenging the reported \nreal estate values regularly. Deutsche Bank originates loans for distribution in the banking market or via securitization. In \nthis context Deutsche Bank frequently retains a portion of the syndicated loans while securitized positions may be entirely \nsold (except where regulation requires retention of economic risk). Mezzanine or other junior tranches of debt are retained \nonly in exceptional cases. The bank also participates in conservatively underwritten unsecured lines of credit to well-\ncapitalized real estate investment trusts and other real estate operating companies. \nCommercial real estate property valuations and rental incomes can be significantly impacted by macro-economic \nconditions and idiosyncratic events affecting the underlying properties. Accordingly, the portfolio is categorized as higher \nrisk and hence subject to the aforementioned tight restrictions on concentration. \nDeutsche Bank’s exposure to Financial and Insurance Activities is € 474.1 billion as of December 31, 2024 which also \nincludes exposures to Asset Backed Securities, Banks, Insurance, Financial intermediaries, Public Sector as well as to \nCorporates including Holding Companies.

Repo and repo-style transactions increased by € 55.5 billion, mainly driven by increased firm trading \nactivities and client flows. From a regional perspective, the increase was primarily attributable to counterparties domiciled \nin the United Kingdom and United State of America. Off-balance sheet positions increased by € 25.3 billion, mainly driven \nby new commitments issued during the period. Loans increased by € 13.8 billion, primarily in the Investment Bank. Debt \nSecurities at fair value through profit and loss increased by € 8.1 billion, mainly due to client flows and desk positioning \nand increase in OTC Derivatives of € 5.0 billion is primarily due to increase in foreign exchange derivatives product. \nThe Group uses risk mitigation techniques as described above to optimize Corporate Bank and Investment Bank credit \nexposures and reduce potential credit losses. The tables for “net” exposure disclose the development of the bank’s \nCorporate Bank and Investment Bank credit exposures net of collateral, guarantees and hedges. \nRisk Mitigation for Credit Exposure \nStrategic Corporate Lending (“SCL”) unit helps to mitigate the risk of the bank’s corporate credit exposures. The notional \namount of SCL’s risk reduction activities increased from € 37.7 billion as of December 31, 2023, to € 43.2 billion as of \nDecember 31, 2024.  \nAs of year-end 2024, SCL mitigated the credit risk of € 38.4 billion of loans and lending-related commitments, through synthetic \ncollateralized loan obligations supported predominantly by financial guarantees. This position totaled € 32.0 billion as of \nDecember 31, 2023.  \nSCL also held credit derivatives with an underlying notional amount of € 4.7 billion as of December 31, 2024. The position \ntotaled € 5.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. The credit derivatives used for the bank’s portfolio management activities are \naccounted for at fair value. \nThe bank executes additional hedges in other businesses and at a group level to reduce single name concentration risks and \nmanage its capital efficiently. These hedges are likely to increase in the medium-term as the bank drives the next stages of \nits strategic delivery.

Consumer Finance business is \nuncollateralized, loan risk depends on client quality. Various lending requirements are stipulated, including (but not limited \nto) client rating, maximum loan amounts and maximum tenors, and are adapted to individual circumstances of the \nborrower (i.e., for consumer loans maximum loan amount and maximum tenor taking into account amongst others \ncustomer net income). Given the largely homogeneous nature of this portfolio, counterparty credit-worthiness and ratings \nare derived by utilizing an automated decision engine. \nMortgage business is financing of real estates with focus on residential properties (primarily owner-occupied) sold by \nvarious business channels in Europe, primarily in Germany but also in Spain and Italy. The level of credit risk of the mortgage \nloan portfolio is determined by assessing the quality of the client and the underlying collateral. The loan amounts are \ngenerally larger than Consumer Finance loans and they are extended for longer time horizons. Based on the bank’s \nunderwriting criteria and processes and the diversified portfolio (customers/properties) with respective collateralization, \nthe mortgage portfolio is categorized as lower risk, while consumer finance is categorized as high risk. \n"}

While the \nlevel of credit risk for the Lombard portfolio is determined by assessing the quality of the underlying collateral, the level \nof credit risk for the structured portfolio is determined by assessing both the quality of the client and the collateral. \nProducts range from secured Lombard and mortgage loans to current accounts (Europe only), credit lines and other loans; \nto a lesser extent derivatives and contingencies.  \nPrivate Bank mortgage loan-to-value1 \nDec 31, 2024 \nDec 31, 2023 \n≤ 50% \n65% \n65% \n> 50 ≤ 70% \n16% \n16% \n> 70 ≤ 90% \n10% \n11% \n> 90 ≤ 100% \n3% \n3% \n> 100 ≤ 110% \n2% \n2% \n> 110 ≤ 130% \n2% \n2% \n> 130% \n1% \n1% \n1 When assigning the exposure to the corresponding LTV buckets, the exposure amounts are distributed according to their relative share of the underlying assessed real \nestate value \nThe LTV expresses the amount of exposure as a percentage of the underlying real estate value. \nThe Group’s LTV ratios are calculated using the total exposure divided by the current determined value of the respective \nproperties. These values are monitored and updated if necessary, on a regular basis. The exposure of transactions that are \nadditionally backed by liquid collateral is reduced by the respective collateral values, whereas any prior charges increase \nthe corresponding total exposure. The LTV calculation includes exposure which is secured by real estate collateral. Any \nmortgage lending exposure that is collateralized exclusively by any other type of collateral is not included in the LTV \ncalculation. \nThe creditor’s creditworthiness, the LTV and the quality of collateral is an integral part of the Group’s risk management \nwhen originating loans and when monitoring and steering the Group’s credit risks. In general, the Group is willing to accept \nhigher LTV’s, the better the creditor’s creditworthiness is. Nevertheless, restrictions of LTV apply e.g. for countries with \nnegative economic outlook or expected declines of real estate values. \nAs of December 31, 2024, 65% of the Group’s exposure related to the mortgage lending portfolio had an LTV ratio below \nor equal to 50% compared to 65% as of December 31, 2023.  \nFocus areas in 2024 \nAs previously mentioned in the Key risk themes section, Deutsche Bank has identified commercial real estate, the \nautomotive industry and climate risk as focus areas of the Group in 2024. \nCommercial Real Estate \nCommercial Real Estate (CRE) markets continue to face headwinds due to the impacts of higher interest rates, reduced \nmarket liquidity combined with tightened lending conditions, and structural changes in the office sector. The market stress \nhas been more pronounced in the U.S. where property price indices show a more substantial decline of CRE asset values \nfrom recent peaks compared to Europe and APAC. Especially, within the office segment, the market weakness is most \nevident in the U.S., reflected in subdued leasing activity and higher vacancy rates compared to Europe. Recent market data \nindicate stabilization in some markets. For example, a key CRE price index curve in the U.S. has flattened over the past year, \nindicating property market values in the U.S. have bottomed out on a broad average while some value decline can still be \nobserved in weak office submarkets. In Europe, signs of stabilization are emerging particularly in residential, logistics and \nhospitality property sectors. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 187, "text": "155 \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisk and capital performance \nAnnual Report 2024 \nCredit Risk Exposure \nIn the current environment, the main risk for the portfolio is related to refinancing and extension of maturing loans which \nis negatively affected by the impact of higher interest rates on collateral values and debt service. CRE loans often have a \nsignificant portion of principal payable at maturity. Under current market conditions, borrowers may have difficulty \nobtaining a new loan to repay the maturing debt or to meet conditions that allow extension of loans. This risk is further \namplified for loans in the office segment due to increased uncertainty about letting prospects for office properties. \nDeutsche Bank is closely monitoring the CRE portfolio for development of such risks. \nThe Group continues to proactively work with borrowers to address upcoming maturities to establish terms for loan \namendments and extensions, which in many cases, are classified as forbearance triggering Stage 2 classification under \nIFRS 9 but are not always deemed modifications under IFRS (please see modification of financial assets and financial \nliabilities section). However, in certain cases, no agreement can be reached on loan extensions or loan amendments and \nthe borrower’s inability to restructure or refinance leads to a default. This has resulted in higher Stage 3 ECL’s in 2023 and \n2024. Overall, uncertainty remains with respect to future defaults and the timing of a full recovery in the CRE markets. \nThe CRE portfolio consists of lending arrangements originated across various parts of the bank and client segments. The \nCRE portfolio under the Group’s CRE definition includes exposures reported under the Main Credit Exposure Categories \nby Industry Sectors for Real Estate Activities NACE and exposures reported under other NACE classifications including \nFinancial and Insurance Activities. \nWithin the CRE portfolio, the Group differentiates between recourse and non-recourse financing. Recourse CRE financings \ntypically have a lower inherent risk profile based on recourse to creditworthy entities or individuals, in addition to mortgage \ncollateral. Recourse CRE exposures range from secured recourse lending for business or commercial properties to property \ncompanies, Wealth Management clients, as well as other private and corporate clients. \nNon-recourse financings rely on sources of repayment that are typically limited to the cash flows generated by the \nfinanced property and the ability to refinance such loans may be constrained by the underlying property value and income \nstream generated by such property at the time of refinancing. \nThe entire CRE loan portfolio is subject to periodic stress testing under Deutsche Bank’s Group Wide Stress Test \nFramework. In addition, Deutsche Bank uses bespoke portfolio stress testing for certain sub-segments of the CRE loan \nportfolio to obtain a more comprehensive view of potential downside risks. For the year ending December 31, 2024, the \nGroup performed a bespoke portfolio stress test on a subset of the non-recourse financing portfolio deemed higher risk \nbased on its heightened sensitivity to current CRE market stress factors, including higher interest rates, declining collateral \nvalues and elevated refinancing risk due to loan structures with a high proportion of their outstanding principal balance \npayable at maturity. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the non-recourse portfolio subject to bespoke portfolio stress testing, also referred to as the \nhigher risk CRE portfolio or the stress-tested CRE portfolio, amounted to € 29.3 billion of the € 36.5 billion non-recourse \nCRE portfolio, excluding only sub-portfolios with less impacted risk drivers such as data centers and municipal social \nhousing, which benefit from strong underlying demand fundamentals. The reduction in the non-recourse CRE portfolio \nand stress-tested CRE portfolio since December 31, 2023 was € 1.7 billion and € 1.9 billion, respectively, mainly driven by \nloan repayments and loan sales partially offset by new loan originations. \nThe following table provides an overview of the Group’s Real Estate Activities and other industry sectors (NACE \nclassification) contributing to Deutsche Bank’s non-recourse and stress-tested CRE portfolio as of December 31, 2024, \nand December 31, 2023, respectively. \nOverview of CRE portfolio \nDec 31, 2024 \nDec 31, 2023 \nin € m. \nGross Carrying \nAmount¹ \nAllowance for \nCredit Losses² \nGross Carrying \nAmount¹ \nAllowance for \nCredit Losses² \nReal Estate Activities³ \n49,859 \n664 \n49,267 \n460 \nthereof: non-recourse \n23,979 \n547 \n25,073 \n382 \nthereof: stress-tested portfolio \n20,361 \n527 \n21,331 \n364 \nOther industry sectors³ non-recourse \n12,484 \n248 \n13,119 \n225 \nthereof: stress-tested portfolio \n8,944 \n126 \n9,879 \n114 \nTotal non-recourse CRE portfolio \n36,463 \n795 \n38,192 \n606 \nthereof: stress-tested portfolio \n29,305 \n653 \n31,210 \n478 \n1 Loans at amortized cost \n2 Allowance for credit losses do not include allowance for country risk \n3 Industry sector by NACE (Nomenclature des Activités Économiques dans la Communauté Européenne) code \n"}

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 189, "text": "157 \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisk and capital performance \nAnnual Report 2024 \nCredit Risk Exposure \nStage classification and provisioning levels are primarily based on the Group’s assessment of a borrower’s ability to \ngenerate recurring cash flows, its ability to obtain refinancing at the loan’s maturity, and an assessment of the financed \nproperty’s collateral value. Deutsche Bank actively monitors these factors for potential signs of deterioration to ensure \ntimely adjustment of the borrower’s loan classifications. When a loan is deemed to be impaired, the Group calculates \nrequired credit loss provisions using multiple potential scenarios for loan resolution, weighted by their expected \nprobabilities and taking into account information available at that point. Such assessments are inherently subjective with \nrespect to scenario weightings and subject to various assumptions, including future cash flows generated by a property \nand potential property liquidation proceeds. These assumptions are subject to uncertainties which are exacerbated in the \ncurrent volatile market environment such that deviating developments to initial assumptions could have a material future \nimpact on calculated provisions. Additional uncertainty exists within the office sector due to the uncertain long-term \nimpact of remote working arrangements on demand for office space. The Group remains highly selective around new \nbusiness, focusing on more resilient property types such as industrial or logistics. \nWhile central banks have started to cut short-term interest rates, the Group expects current CRE market conditions to \ncontinue, in the near-term particularly in the office sector which could result in further deterioration of asset quality and \nelevated credit loss provisions, which is reflected in the communicated guidance for credit loss provisions for 2025.  \nSince the onset of the CRE market deterioration, the Group aims to assess the downside risk of additional credit losses in \nits higher risk non-recourse portfolio through a temporary bespoke stress testing focused on examining property values \nmovements as basis of to identify potential losses on a portfolio basis. Stressed values are derived by applying an observed \npeak-to-trough market index decline (a commercial property value market index) to the appraised values plus an additional \nhaircut, differentiated by property type and region. Implying a liquidation scenario, the stress analysis assumes a loss to \noccur on a loan when the stressed property value is less than the outstanding loan balance, i.e., the stress LTV beyond \n100%.  \nBased on the stress test assumptions and utilizing the stress-tested CRE portfolio of € 29.3 billion as of December 31, \n2024, as a starting point, stress could result, in a worst case scenario, in approximately € 1.2 billion of credit losses, over \nmultiple years based on the respective maturity profile. The allowance recorded against the stress tested portfolio was \n€ 0.7 billion as of December 31, 2024. In a normalized stress scenario, taking into account recently observed trends and \ninformation, including indications of stabilizing CRE markets, the bank would expect incremental provisions of € 0.5 billion \nover the aforementioned period. \nThe bespoke stress test has numerous limitations, including but not restricted to lack of differentiation based on individual \nasset performance, specific location or asset desirability, all of which could have a material impact on potential stress \nlosses. Furthermore, calculated stress losses are sensitive to potential further deterioration of peak-to-trough index values \nand assumptions about incremental haircuts and incremental stress loss can therefore change in future. Changes in \nunderlying assumptions could lead to a wider range of stress results and hence the Group's bespoke stress approach \nshould be viewed as one of multiple possible scenarios. While the stress test aims to assess potential losses in an adverse \nscenario, Deutsche Bank believes that based on currently available information, the ECL estimate related to the Group’s \nCRE portfolio is within a reasonable range and thus represents the bank’s best estimate, considering the advanced stage \nof the current down cycle which is pointing towards stabilization as real estate values have adjusted to the shocks from \nhigher interest rates and remote working trends \nAutomotives \nThe automotive industry environment poses a growing risk to Deutsche Bank’s Automotive and Supplier portfolio which is \nmonitored closely given the challenging economic environment in Europe, Electric Vehicle (EV) transition and competition \nfrom China. \nThe industry outlook from automotives remains subdued. Although car registrations have stabilized during 2024, the trend \nremains negative in key markets Germany, France, and Italy, while the U.S. and China have shown solid volume growth in \n2024. The outlook however remains challenging especially for EU domiciled companies amid risks from Automotive \nManufacturers facing potential EU fines as EV sales are well below mandated targets, potential U.S. import tariffs affecting \nsales in the key market U.S, competition from China and persistent excess capacities around the globe. \nThe difficult industry environment has had limited impact on Deutsche Bank’s automotive and supplier portfolio thus far \nwith only moderate downward rating migrations observed across overall portfolio with 68% of clients rated as investment \ngrade, a 6% point decrease year on year. \n"}

Higher risk portfolios, including smaller suppliers, are closely tracked and \ntightly managed. Additionally, there have been limited loan loss allowance increases across counterparties domiciled in \nGermany where most of the allowance relates to historical stage 3 cases. Exposures in Automotives have been pro-actively \nscreened over the past 18 months with higher risk clients added to watchlists.

This will generate increased risks for companies with carbon intensive business models who are unable to \nexecute on credible transition plans. Deutsche Bank is exposed to transition risks via its lending to, and other business \nactivities with, carbon intensive clients and physical assets. \nPhysical risks, defined as the potential for physical damage and associated financial and non-financial losses due to rising \ntemperatures, are increasing in frequency and intensity. Deutsche Bank is exposed to physical risks via its lending to, and \nother business activities with, clients and physical assets in regions which are vulnerable to acute events (e.g. wildfires, \nhurricanes) and chronic events (e.g. rising sea levels).  \nRisk identification, assessment and management \nManaging climate transition and physical risks is a key component of the bank’s risk management and wider sustainability \nstrategy. Climate risks are embedded into the bank’s risk frameworks and appetite, prioritizing clients and portfolios with \nthe highest vulnerability based on a broad range of bespoke climate risk identification and classification approaches, \nincluding risk concentrations. All economic sectors are included in the analysis and the carbon-intensive sectors are \nsubject to particular focus. \nA comprehensive Climate materiality assessment is performed on an annual basis which assesses potential impacts across \na range of scenarios and timeframes. A detailed description is provided in the “Impact, risk and opportunity management” \nsection within the “Climate Change” chapter of the Sustainability Statement. The assessment utilizes a range of \nquantitative estimation approaches including emissions and emission intensity estimates, physical risk loss estimates \nacross a range of different temperature scenarios and client transition and physical risk scorecards. The materiality \nassessment is based on internal ratings migration for corporate lending exposures and the impact on collateral value for \nreal estate exposures The quantitative assessment is supplemented by qualitative views from internal subject matter \nexperts. The bank also conducts annual stress testing of climate and physical risks across a range of scenarios and \ntimeframes. \nThe results of these assessments are utilized to quantify potential downside risks and to identify clients in higher risk \nportfolios which are subject to enhanced due diligence as part of the bank’s credit approval process. Risk assessments are \nintegrated into the internal credit rating process and are considered as potential triggers for inclusion in the Watchlist. \nDedicated requirements for insurance arrangements are in place for real estate lending. To manage climate transition risks, \nnet zero targets have been established for key carbon intensive sectors with dedicated governance in place to review \ntransactions with a significant impact on target metrics. A detailed presentation and discussion of the bank’s net zero \ntargets is provided in the Initial Transition Plan published in October 2023. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 191, "text": "159 \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisk and capital performance \nAnnual Report 2024 \nCredit Risk Exposure \nForward-looking impact analysis \nBased on the 2024 materiality assessment and climate stress test results the Group concludes that potential credit risk \nimpacts are well-contained in both the short (1-2yr) and medium term (3-5yr) under current policy assumptions, and also \nin a scenario where all stated pledges by governments are enforced. The former scenario is considered most likely to occur \nin the short-to-medium term, that latter scenario is considered less likely to materialize in the current geopolitical \nenvironment. \nThe 2024 materiality assessment concludes that long-term risks are potentially material across all scenarios but with a \nhigh degree of uncertainty over the results reflecting the very long-time frame, up to 25 years, and based on several \nconservative assumptions including static balance sheet. \nRisks to the portfolio would be significantly higher in a disorderly net zero scenario where following a prolonged period of \ninaction governments introduced punitive climate taxes and other policies with a very short implementation period. \nDeutsche Bank considers this scenario to be extremely unlikely to materialize in the short to medium term and thus the \nrisk is reflected in our Economic Capital calculation rather than ECL. \nBoth the materiality assessment and bespoke climate stress test have several limitations including but not limited to high \nlevels of uncertainty on policy developments over the medium-to-long term, difficulty with precisely forecasting the \nlocation and severity of physical risk events and assumptions around the adaptive capabilities of our clients. Utilization of \nmultiple scenarios is designed to mitigate these uncertainties. \nBased on these estimates Deutsche Bank believes that ECL estimates for higher transition and physical risk exposures are \nwithin reasonable ranges and require no additional corrective measure. \nA sensitivity analysis has been undertaken as part of the climate stress test that is based on reasonable ranges of potential \nvariation for carbon prices and energy prices. The stressed ECL impacts at a one-year horizon were found to be from a \nsingle digit number for a Current Policies scenario to a low 2-digit figure for a Delayed Transition scenario. These \nestimations are aligned with the outputs of the materiality assessment. \nConclusion \nTo ensure that Deutsche Bank’s expected credit losses (ECL) model was taking into account the uncertainties in the \nmacroeconomic environment throughout 2024, the Group reviewed emerging risks to assess its potential downside and \nto manage the bank’s credit strategy and risk appetite on an ongoing basis. Overall, Deutsche Bank believes the actions \ntaken as a result of these reviews were designated to ensure the bank was adequately provisioned for its expected credit \nlosses as of December 31, 2024. \nAsset Quality \nThis section describes the quality of debt instruments subject to impairment, which under IFRS 9 consist of debt \ninstruments measured at amortized cost, financial instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) \nas well as off balance sheet lending commitments such as loan commitments and financial guarantees (hereafter \ncollectively referred to as “Financial Assets”).  \n"}

In 2023, net outflows from stage 3 \n(excluding POCI) increased compared to 2022.

This section covers modified financial assets that have not been derecognized. \nUnder IFRS 9, when the terms of a Financial Asset are renegotiated or modified and the modification does not result in \nderecognition, a gain or loss is recognized in the income statement as the difference between the original contractual cash \nflows and the modified cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate (EIR). For modified financial assets the \ndetermination of whether the asset’s credit risk has increased significantly reflects the comparison of: \n– The remaining lifetime probability of default (PD) at the reporting date based on the modified terms; with\n– The remaining lifetime PD estimated based on data at initial recognition and based on the original contractual terms.\nThe following table provides the overview of modified financial assets at amortized cost broken down into IFRS 9 stages. \nModified Assets at Amortized Cost \nDec 31, 2024 \nDec 31, 2023 \nin € m. \nStage 1 \nStage 2 \nStage 3 \nStage 3 \nPOCI \nTotal \nStage 1 \nStage 2 \nStage 3 \nStage 3 \nPOCI \nTotal \nAmortized cost carrying amount prior to \nmodification \n0 \n726 \n132 \n0 \n858 \n0 \n1,072 \n220 \n0 \n1,292 \nNet modification gain/losses recognized \n0 \n9 \n(55) \n0 \n(46) \n0 \n5 \n(40) \n0 \n(35) \nIn 2024, the bank has observed the decrease of € 434 million in modified assets at amortized cost due to client related \nmodifications, driven by Investment Bank and Private Bank. \nIn 2024, the Group has not observed any amounts of modified assets that have been upgraded to Stage 1. The bank has \nnot observed any subsequent re-deterioration of those assets into Stages 2 and 3. \nIn 2023, the Group has not observed any amounts of modified assets that have been upgraded to Stage 1. The bank has \nnot observed any subsequent re-deterioration of those assets into Stages 2 and 3. \nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income \nThe fair value of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) subject to impairment under \nIFRS 9 was € 42 billion at December 31, 2024, compared to € 36 billion at December 31, 2023.

Such enforcement activity comprises for example cases where the bank \ncontinues to devote resources (e.g. our Legal Department/CRM workout unit) towards recovery, either via legal channels \nor third party recovery agents. Enforcement activity also applies to cases where the Bank maintains outstanding and \nunsettled legal claims. This is irrespective of whether amounts are expected to be recovered and the recovery timeframe. \nIt may be common practice in certain jurisdictions for recovery cases to span several years. \nAmounts outstanding on financial assets that were written off during the reporting period and are still subject to \nenforcement activity amounted to € 222 million and € 334 million in 2024 and 2023 respectively, mainly in Corporate \nBank. \n"}

A case-by-case approach is \napplied for corporate clients considering each transaction and client-specific facts and circumstances. For consumer loans \nthe bank offers forbearances for a limited period of time, in which the total or partial outstanding or future instalments are \ndeferred to a later point of time. However, the amount not paid including accrued interest during this period must be re-\ncompensated at a later point of time. Repayment options include distribution over residual tenor, a one-off payment or a \ntenor extension. Forbearances are restricted and depending on the economic situation of the client, the Group’s risk \nmanagement strategies and the local legislation. In case a forbearance agreement is entered into, an impairment \nmeasurement is conducted as described below, an impairment charge is taken if necessary and the loan is subsequently \nrecorded as impaired. \nIn the Group’s management and reporting of forborne assets at amortized costs, the bank follows the EBA definition for \nforbearances and non-performing loans (Implementing Technical Standards (ITS) on Supervisory reporting on forbearance \nand non-performing exposures under article 99(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013). Once the conditions mentioned in the \nITS are met, the Group reports the loan as being forborne; removes the asset from the bank’s forbearance reporting, once \nthe discontinuance criteria in the ITS are met (i.e., the contract is considered as performing, a minimum two year probation \nperiod has passed, regular payments of more than an insignificant aggregate amount of principal or interest have been \nmade during at least half of the probation period, and none of the exposures to the debtor is more than 30 days past-due \nat the end of the probation period). \nForborne financial assets at amortized cost \nDec 31, 2024 \nDec 31, 2023 \nPerforming \nNon-performing \nTotal \nforborne \nloans at \namortize\nd \ncost \nPerforming \nNon-performing \nTotal \nforborne \nloans at \namortize\nd \ncost \nin € m. \nStage 1 \nStage 2 \nStage 1 \nStage 2 \nStage 3 \nStage 1 \nStage 2 \nStage 1 \nStage 2 \nStage 3 \nGerman \n174 \n2,248 \n0 \n4 \n1,056 \n3,481 \n426 \n2,356 \n0 \n7 \n812 \n3,600 \nNon-German \n93 \n7,049 \n0 \n16 \n4,687 \n11,845 \n639 \n4,399 \n0 \n194 \n3,632 \n8,864 \nTotal \n267 \n9,297 \n0 \n20 \n5,742 \n15,326 \n1,065 \n6,755 \n0 \n201 \n4,444 \n12,464 \nDevelopment of forborne financial assets at amortized cost \nin € m. \nDec 31, 2024 \nDec 31, 2023 \nBalance beginning of period \n12,464 \n11,143 \nClassified as forborne during the year \n8,572 \n4,007 \nTransferred to non-forborne during the year (including repayments) \n(6,020) \n(2,500) \nCharge-offs \n(211) \n(80) \nExchange rate and other movements \n521 \n(106) \nBalance end of period \n15,326 \n12,464 \nForborne assets at amortized cost increased by € 2.9 billion, or 23% in 2024, largely driven by real estate exposures across \nvarious divisions. \nForborne assets at amortized cost increased by € 1.3 billion, or 12% in 2023.

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 201, "text": "169 \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisk and capital performance \nAnnual Report 2024 \nCredit Risk Exposure \nCollateral Obtained \nThe Group obtains collateral on the balance sheet only in certain cases by either taking possession of collateral held as \nsecurity or by calling upon other credit enhancements. Collateral obtained is made available for sale in an orderly fashion \nor through public auctions, with the proceeds used to repay or reduce outstanding indebtedness. Generally, the bank does \nnot occupy obtained properties for its business use. \nCollateral Obtained during the reporting period \nin € m. \n2024 \n2023 \nCommercial real estate \n251 \n0 \nResidential real estate1 \n3 \n3 \nOther \n0 \n11 \nTotal collateral obtained during the reporting period \n254 \n14 \n1 Carrying amount of foreclosed residential real estate properties amounted to € 17 million as of December 31, 2024 and € 30 million as of December 31, 2023 \nThe increase of € 240m in collateral obtained during 2024 relates to a small number of foreclosed commercial real estate \nproperties in the US. \n The collateral obtained, as shown in the table above, excludes collateral recorded as a result of consolidating \nsecuritization trusts under IFRS 10. In 2024 and 2023, the Group obtained € 4 million of collateral related to these trusts. \nDerivatives – Credit Valuation Adjustment \nThe bank establishes counterparty Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) for OTC derivative transactions to cover expected \ncredit losses. The adjustment amount is determined by assessing the potential credit exposure to a given counterparty and \ntaking into account any collateral held, the effect of any relevant netting arrangements, expected loss given default and \nthe credit risk, based on available market information, including CDS spreads. \nTreatment of default situations under derivatives \nUnlike standard loan assets, the bank generally has more options to manage the credit risk in its derivatives transactions \nwhen movement in the current replacement costs or the behavior of its counterparty indicate that there is the risk that \nupcoming payment obligations under the transactions might not be honored. In these situations, the bank is frequently \nable under the relevant derivatives agreements to obtain additional collateral or to terminate and close-out the derivative \ntransactions at short notice. \nThe master agreements and associated collateralization agreements for OTC derivative transactions executed with its \nclients typically result in the majority of its credit exposure being secured by collateral. It also provides for a broad set of \nstandard or bespoke termination rights, which allows the bank to respond swiftly to a counterparty’s default or to other \ncircumstances which indicate a high probability of failure.  \nThe banks contractual termination rights are supported by internal policies and procedures with defined roles and \nresponsibilities which ensure that potential counterparty defaults are identified and addressed in a timely fashion. These \nprocedures include necessary settlement and trading restrictions. When its decision to terminate derivative transactions \nresults in a residual net obligation owed by the counterparty, the bank restructures the obligation into a non-derivative \nclaim and manage it through its regular work-out process. As a consequence, for accounting purposes the bank typically \ndoes not show any nonperforming derivatives. \nWrong-way risk occurs when exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that \ncounterparty. In compliance with Article 291(2) and (4) CRR the bank has a monthly process to monitor several layers of \nwrong-way risk (specific wrong-way risk, general explicit wrong-way risk at country/industry/region levels and general \nimplicit wrong-way risk, whereby relevant exposures arising from transactions subject to wrong-way risk are automatically \nselected and presented for comment to the responsible credit officer). A wrong-way risk report is then sent to Credit Risk \nsenior management on a monthly basis. In addition, the bank utilized its established process for calibrating its own alpha \nfactor (as defined in Article 284 (9) CRR) to estimate the overall wrong-way risk in its derivatives and securities financing \ntransactions portfolio. The Private Bank Germany’s derivative counterparty risk is immaterial to the Group and collateral \nheld is typically in the form of cash. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 202, "text": "170 \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisk and capital performance \nAnnual Report 2024 \nCredit Risk Exposure \nCredit Exposure from Derivatives \nAll exchange traded derivatives are cleared through central counterparties (“CCPs”), the rules and regulations of which \nprovide for daily margining of all current and future credit risk positions emerging out of such transactions. To the extent \npossible, the bank also uses CCP services for OTC derivative transactions (“OTC clearing”); thereby the bank benefits from \nthe credit risk mitigation achieved through the CCP’s settlement system. \nThe Dodd-Frank Act provides for an extensive framework for the regulation of OTC derivatives, including mandatory \nclearing, platform trading and transaction reporting of certain OTC derivatives, as well as rules regarding registration, \ncapital, margin, business conduct standards, recordkeeping and other requirements for swap dealers, security-based swap \ndealers, major swap participants and major security-based swap participants. The Dodd-Frank Act and related CFTC rules \nrequire OTC clearing in the United States for certain standardized OTC derivative transactions, including certain interest \nrate swaps and index credit default swaps. Margin requirements for non-cleared derivative transactions in the U.S. started \nin September 2016. The European Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 on OTC Derivatives, Central Counterparties and Trade \nRepositories (“EMIR”) introduced a number of risk mitigation techniques for non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives in 2013 \nand the reporting of OTC and exchange traded derivatives in 2014. Mandatory clearing of certain standardized OTC \nderivatives transactions in the EU began in June 2016, and margin requirements for un-cleared OTC derivative transactions \nin the EU started in February 2017. Deutsche Bank implemented the exchange of both initial and variation margin in the \nEU from February 2017 for the first category of counterparties subject to the EMIR margin for un-cleared derivatives \nrequirements.  \nThe CFTC has adopted rules implementing the most significant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. More recently, in \nSeptember 2020, the CFTC issued a final rule on the cross-border application of U.S. swap rules, which builds on, and in \nsome cases supersedes the CFTC’s cross-border guidance from 2013 and related no-action relief letters. In October 2020, \nalso pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFTC finalized regulations to impose position limits on certain commodities and \neconomically equivalent swaps, futures and options.  \nThe SEC has also finalized rules regarding registration, trade reporting, capital, margin, risk mitigation techniques, business \nconduct standards, trade acknowledgement and verification, recordkeeping and financial reporting, and cross-border \nrequirements for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants. Compliance with these \nrequirements was generally required as of November 2021.  \nFinally, U.S. prudential regulators (the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Farm \nCredit Administration and the Federal Housing Finance Agency) have adopted final rules establishing margin requirements \nfor non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps that are applicable to swap dealers and security-based swap dealers that \nare subject to U.S. prudential regulations (such as Deutsche Bank) in lieu of the CFTC’s and the SEC’s margin rules. \nDeutsche Bank implemented the exchange of both initial and variation margin for uncleared derivatives in the U.S. from \nSeptember 2016, for the first category of counterparties subject to the U.S. prudential regulators’ margin requirements. \nAdditional initial margin requirements for smaller counterparties have been phased in from September 2017 through \nSeptember 2022, with the relevant compliance dates depending in each case on the transactional volume of the parties \nand their affiliates.  \nThe following table shows a breakdown of notional amounts and gross market values for assets and liabilities of exchange \ntraded and OTC derivative transactions on the basis of clearing channel. \n"}

Despite creating a dent, those events were not material enough to \noutweigh risk-on mood. Against this backdrop, the Bank navigated well through the markets and successfully concluded \nits issuance activity at 18 billion euros, in line with guidance of ending the year at the upper end of a 13 to 18 billion euro \nrange. \nIn contrast to market fears, credit markets showed a constructive performance despite the multiple disruptions with \nbroader indices trading tighter vs. year end 2023. Following rating upgrades in 2023, the bank’s spreads rallied in the first \nhalf of 2024 while trading roughly flat in the second half. Otherwise, no idiosyncratic anomalies, which led to wider levels. \nThe bank’s CDS and EUR spreads performed well this year, the bank’s USD spreads exhibited an even better performance. \nThe total issuance volume of € 18.0 is split as follows: € 3.0 billion in capital issuances, € 6.9 billion of senior non-preferred \nfunding, € 8.1 billion in senior preferred. From a currency perspective, the total issuance volume is divided as follows: Euros \n(€ 9.6 billion), U.S. dollars (€ 6.2 billion), Japanese Yen (€ 0.6 billion) and other currencies aggregated (€ 1.6 billion). The \nGroup’s investor base for 2024 issuances was as follows: asset managers and pension funds (62%), banks (11%), retail \ncustomers (8%), insurance companies (7%), other institutional investors (7%), Governments and agencies (2%) and Other \n(3%). The geographical distribution was split between Germany (16%), rest of Europe (44%), U.S. (23%), Asia/Pacific (14%) \nand Other (3%). The average spread of issuance over 3-months-Euribor/RFR (Risk Free Rate) was 110bp for the full year. \nThe average tenor was 5.6 years. The Group issued the following volumes over each quarter: Q1: € 5.1 billion, Q2: \n€ 5.6 billion, Q3: € 5.6 billion and Q4: € 1.7 billion. \nDeutsche Bank’s issuance plan for 2025 is € 15-20 billion, broadly in line with last year’s plan. Focus will be on senior non-\npreferred bonds and capital instruments. Senior preferred issuances will be primarily in non-benchmark format. The Group \nalso plans to raise a portion of this funding in U.S. dollar and may enter into cross currency swaps to manage any residual \nrequirements. The Bank has total capital markets maturities, excluding legally exercisable calls, of approximately \n€ 12 billion. Furthermore, the Bank issued structured notes with a volume of around € 10 billion in 2024 and plans to issue \n~ € 9 billion in 2025. This activity is conducted by the FIC division and not part of the Treasury issuance plan. \nFunding Diversification \nIn 2024, total external funding increased by € 50.6 billion from € 970.3 billion at December 31, 2023, to € 1,020.9 billion \nat December 31, 2024. Funding from the Corporate Bank has increased by € 23.3 billion, most pronounced in sight \ndeposits. In the Private Bank, growth of € 12.6 billion was primarily driven by term deposits. The unsecured Wholesale \nFunding portfolio increased by € 6.5 billion, thereof € 3.6 billion from Investment Bank deposits. In addition, Capital \nMarkets and Equity increased by € 16.8 billion driven by an increase of € 1.6 billion in Equity and € 15.2 billion in long-term \nDebt Issuances. Secured funding and shorts have decreased by € 18.3 billion, driven by € 15.0 billion prepayments of \nTLTRO (Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations) and € 3.3 billion reductions in repurchase operations. Additional \ngrowth in the Other Customers bucket of € 9.9 billion was mainly driven by increase in Long-Term Debt due to growth \nfrom the ETF structures.  \n"}

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 216, "text": "184 \nDeutsche Bank  \nRisk and capital performance \nAnnual Report 2024 \nLiquidity Risk Exposure \nAsset Encumbrance \nThis section refers to asset encumbrance in the Group of institutions consolidated for banking regulatory purposes \npursuant to the German Banking Act. Therefore, this excludes insurance companies or companies outside the finance \nsector. Assets pledged by insurance subsidiaries are included in Note 20 “Assets Pledged and Received as Collateral” of \nthe consolidated financial statements, and restricted assets held to satisfy obligations to insurance companies’ policy \nholders are included within Note 37 “Information on Subsidiaries” of the consolidated financial statements. \nEncumbered assets primarily comprise those on- and off-balance sheet assets that are pledged as collateral against \nsecured funding, collateral swaps, and other collateralized obligations. Additionally, in line with EBA technical standards \non regulatory asset encumbrance reporting, assets placed with settlement systems, including default funds and initial \nmargins, as well as other assets pledged which cannot be freely withdrawn such as mandatory minimum reserves at central \nbanks, are considered encumbered. The balances presented also include derivative margin receivable assets as \nencumbered under relevant EBA guidelines. \nReadily available assets are those on- and off-balance sheet assets that are not otherwise encumbered, and which are in \nfreely transferrable form. Unencumbered financial assets at fair value, other than securities borrowed or purchased under \nresale agreements and positive market value from derivatives, and available for sale investments are all assumed to be \nreadily available. \nThe readily available value represents the on- and off-balance sheet carrying amount or fair value rather than any form of \nstressed liquidity value (see the “High Quality Liquid Assets” for an analysis of unencumbered liquid assets available under \na liquidity stress scenario). Other unencumbered on- and off-balance sheet assets are those assets that have not been \npledged as collateral against secured funding or other collateralized obligations or are otherwise not considered to be \nreadily available. Included in this category are securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements and positive \nmarket value from derivatives. Similarly, for loans and other advances to customers, these would only be viewed as readily \navailable to the extent they are already in a pre-packaged transferrable format and have not already been used to generate \nfunding. This represents the most conservative view given that an element of such loans currently shown in other assets \ncould be packaged into a format that would be suitable for use to generate funding. \nEncumbered and unencumbered assets \nDec 31, 2024 \nCarrying value \nUnencumbered assets \nin € m. \n(unless stated otherwise) \nAssets \nEncumbered \nassets \nReadily \navailable \nOther \nDebt securities \n179 \n80 \n99 \n0 \nEquity instruments \n4 \n0 \n4 \n0 \nOther assets: \nCash and due from banks & Interest earning deposits with Banks \n154 \n14 \n139 \n0 \nSecurities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements¹ \n41 \n0 \n0 \n41 \nFinancial assets at fair value through profit and loss² \nTrading assets \n12 \n0 \n12 \n0 \nPositive market value from derivative financial instruments \n292 \n0 \n0 \n292 \nSecurities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements¹ \n105 \n0 \n0 \n105 \nOther financial assets at fair value through profit or loss \n3 \n0 \n3 \n0 \nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income² \n8 \n0 \n5 \n3 \nLoans \n517 \n48 \n41 \n427 \nOther assets \n75 \n40 \n0 \n35 \nTotal \n1,389 \n183 \n303 \n903 \n1 Securities borrowed and securities purchased under resale agreements are all shown as other unencumbered.

As the European Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) was \nnot transposed into German law as of December 31, 2024, the bank applied the European Sustainability Reporting \nStandards (ESRS) as reporting framework as allowed by Section 315c (3) HGB in conjunction with Section 289d HGB and, \non that basis, discloses governance, strategy, impact, risk and opportunity management, metrics and targets for material \nsustainability matters. \nIn addition, the Sustainability Statement complies with the disclosure obligations under Article 8 (1) and (3) of the \nTaxonomy Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2020/852) and the respective specifications in Articles 4 and 10 (5) of the \nassociated Disclosures delegated Act (Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178). \nThe Sustainability Statement was prepared on a consolidated basis and the scope of consolidation is the same as for the \nGroup’s consolidated financial statements. The bank did not identify any subsidiaries not included in the Group’s financial \nstatements that require inclusion in the Sustainability Statement. Unless otherwise stated, information disclosed regarding \nthe Deutsche Bank Group also applies to Deutsche Bank AG . Specificities for certain consolidated subsidiaries, for example \nDWS Group GmbH & Co. KGaA, are separately highlighted where necessary. Deutsche Bank AG is the parent company of \nDeutsche Bank Group and its most material component. \nManagement of Deutsche Bank AG is responsible for setting the sustainability strategy as well as related governance for \nboth Deutsche Bank AG and the Deutsche Bank Group. For further details please refer to the “Sustainability strategy” and \n“Governance” sections in this Sustainability Statement. Deutsche Bank AG is based in Germany and, through foreign \nbranches, operates globally. For further details on the regional distribution of Deutsche Bank AG’s own workforce please \nrefer to chapter “Standalone parent company information (HGB)” in the Combined Management Report. \nThe material sustainability-related topics and their impacts, risks and opportunities in relation to the bank’s upstream, own \noperations and downstream value chain as described in “Deutsche Bank Group” within the “Combined Management \nReport” were determined by the outcome of the double materiality assessment as required by ESRS 1 – General \nrequirements. A detailed description of the materiality assessment process can be found in the chapter “Double materiality \nassessment”. \nThe material sustainability topics in the Sustainability Statement are structured into the sections “Environmental \nInformation”, “Social Information” and “Governance Information”. The following overarching chapters are included in the \n“General Information” as they cover environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters holistically and are subject to \nvarious ESRS requirements: “Governance”, “Double materiality assessment”, “Sustainability strategy”, “Stakeholder \nengagement and thought leadership”, “Sustainable Finance”, “ESG due diligence” and “Supply chain management” \n(“upstream value chain”). “Sustainable Finance” is part of Deutsche Bank’s business model and includes by its nature \nEnvironmental, Social and Governance elements. Given that the ESRS do not provide a topical standard for Sustainable \nFinance, this topic is treated as an entity-specific topic subject to ESRS 2 disclosures. “Supply chain management” covers \nall identified material topics of Deutsche Bank’s upstream value chain and thus, is subject to various ESRS requirements. \nAccordingly, the chapter includes all material disclosures pertaining to the cross-cutting standard ESRS 2 and the topical \nstandards ESRS E1 and ESRS G1. \nThe bank discloses comparative information for figures reported in the previous reporting period. In those instances, in \nwhich comparative information was aligned to presentation in the current year this is mentioned in the respective chapter. \nWhere the bank made use of the option to omit classified or sensitive information or matters in the course of negotiation \naccording to ESRS 2 – General disclosures, BP-1 5(d) and (e), this is disclosed in the relevant chapter of the Sustainability \nStatement. \nPolicies mentioned in this report are available internally on Deutsche Bank’s internal “Policy Portal”. \n"}

In accordance with the \nrecommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code, the Supervisory Board also determines the ratio of fixed \ncompensation to variable compensation as well as the ratio of short to long-term variable compensation \nThe compensation system for the Management Board consists of fixed and variable compensation components. The fixed \ncompensation consists of base salary, fringe benefits and contributions to the company pension schemes. The variable \ncompensation is divided into Short-Term Incentives (STI) and Long-Term Incentives (LTI). In the STI, three to five objectives \nfor measuring individual and divisional performance over a period of one year are set in the beginning of the period and \ndisclosed retrospectively. For LTI, four objectives, which are identical for all Management Board Members are set and \ndisclosed ex ante. The STI is determined after one year, while the LTI is only determined after an assessment period of \nthree years. \nSustainability-related performance targets and metrics \nDeutsche Bank strives to make a contribution to an environmentally friendly, socially inclusive and well-governed \ncorporate landscape as well as to support its clients in their green transformation.

German Gender Quota Law (Zweites Führungspositionen-Gesetz - FüPoG II). \nFor the 2024-2026 LTI plan the Supervisory Board focuses on ESG objectives which form 20% of the total LTI for this \nperiod: \n– Environmental target: The objective of driving climate risk-management is linked to the disclosed carbon reduction \ntargets for defined carbon intensive sectors that were published when setting of CO2 reduction target pathways for \nkey industries. This metrics measures performance against the published pathway plus an allowed deviation (risk \nappetite).  \n– Social target: The objective of increasing gender diversity in accordance with the 2 German Gender Quota Law (Zweites \nFührungspositionen-Gesetzt – FüPoG II) focuses on female representation on the two levels below the Management \nBoard (MB-1) and Management Board (MB-2) positions, which combates discrimination within the Management Board \nsuccession pipeline as well as to promote equal opportunity. \n– Governance target: The corporate governance objective consists of the Control Risk Management Grade (CRMG) and \nprogress made in the Anti-Money-Laundering / Know-Your-Client remediation activities. The CRMG measures the \ncontrol environment based on the performance of the individual divisions, including critical and overdue findings, but \nalso cultural issues such as self-identified risk acceptance.

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 232, "text": " \n \n200  \nDeutsche Bank  \nGeneral information \nAnnual Report 2024 \nGovernance \nRisk management and internal control processes \nThe primary risks in sustainability reporting are that either the Sustainability Statement may not present a true and fair \nview due to inadvertent or intentional errors or the publication of the Sustainability Statement is not performed on a timely \nbasis. This may reduce stakeholder confidence or cause reputational damage and may have legal or regulatory \nconsequences. A lack of fair presentation arises when one or more disclosures contain misstatements or omissions that are \nmaterial. A misstatement is considered material, if it could influence economic decisions that users of the Sustainability \nStatement make.  \nTo mitigate these risks associated with sustainability reporting, Deutsche Bank has established internal controls over \nsustainability reporting including multi-layered validation and review procedures throughout the reporting process to \nensure the reliability of the disclosures in the Sustainability Statement. A key component of assessing the risk of material \nmisstatement is the use of a risk ranking that considers impact and probability. In establishing internal controls over \nsustainability reporting, the bank has prioritized completeness and accuracy as objectives to ensure the integrity and \nreliability of its Sustainability Statement.  \nThe system of internal controls over sustainability reporting covers all stages of the reporting process, from data handling \nand data collection to disclosure. This process involves cross-departmental collaboration with clear roles and \nresponsibilities to ensure consistent implementation across the bank’s operations. The components of this framework \ninclude preventive, detective and corrective controls. Preventive controls are embedded at the initial stages of data \ncollection within the respective functions providing input to the Sustainability Statement. Detective controls include \nindependent reviews by the control functions. Corrective controls address issues discovered through audits, ensuring \nprompt correction and continuous improvement. \nNo control system, including internal controls over sustainability reporting, no matter how well conceived and operated, \ncan provide absolute assurance that the objectives of that control system are met. As such, disclosure controls and \nprocedures or systems for internal controls over sustainability reporting may not prevent all errors.  \nMeasuring effectiveness of the system of internal control over sustainability reporting \nTo enhance the effectiveness of the system of internal control over sustainability reporting, the framework is reviewed and \nextended on a yearly basis applying the controls that the bank deems necessary to mitigate the risk to a tolerable level in \nline with the bank’s risk appetite. The key controls are: \n– Four-eyes controls with a clear segregation of duties between producer and reviewer, as well as reviews by Senior \nManagement \n– Completeness of control documentation as well as adequate control performance covering all process steps (end-to-\nend) when compiling the content for the Sustainability Statement, including documentation of data sources, \nreconciliations, analytical controls or inventory controls \nThe control evidences are derived from procedures that are integrated into the daily duties of staff or from relevant policies \nand procedures. Information obtained from other sources also serves as a crucial component of the evaluation, as it has \nthe potential to either bring additional control concerns to the attention of management or to substantiate findings. Such \ninformation sources may include: \n– Reports on audits carried out by or on behalf of regulatory authorities \n– External Auditor reports \n– Reports commissioned to evaluate the effectiveness of outsourced processes to third parties \nThe findings, if any, from Deutsche Bank’s internal controls over sustainability reporting process are addressed to the \nrespective functions in a timely manner to ensure adequate remediation and thereby enhance the reporting process. \nFurthermore, the Management Board and the Supervisory Board and further oversight bodies, including Audit Committee, \nare informed about any potential findings. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the management was informed about the results of the effectiveness of the system of internal \ncontrol over sustainability reporting.

In line with the reporting requirements, \nthe DMA includes the perspectives of impact and financial materiality. The assessment was prepared on a consolidated \nbasis. The scope of consolidation corresponds to that of the Groups consolidated financial statements. The bank did not \nidentify any subsidiaries not included in the Group’s financial statements that require inclusion in the DMA. The boundaries \nof the assessment were further determined by the bank’s value chain, i.e. the bank’s own operations as well as its upstream \nand downstream value chain.

All ESRS topics and the bank’s material topics from its last materiality assessment were included \nin the longlist. The bank further enriched the longlist with topics from several sector agnostic and sector specific \nframeworks and standards, sustainability-related regulation and voluntary principles, ESG ratings, publications of non-\ngovernmental organizations and a peer benchmark. The bank determined a topic’s frequency of occurrence in the sources \nresearched to get a better understanding of a topic’s relevance and consolidated corresponding topics. This process led \nto a condensed list (shortlist) of 14 potentially material topics with 33 sub-topics, including all ESRS-topics as well as \nfurther entity specific topics.  \nIdentification of impacts, risks and opportunities (IRO) \nDeutsche Bank provided a definition for each shortlist topic reflecting the content of the respective ESRS with adaptations \nto the bank’s context. Furthermore, the value chain relevance of each topic was pre-assessed by mapping it to the bank’s \nvalue chain at sub-topic level. For topics that were not deemed to trigger material impacts, risks and/or opportunities (IRO) \nat a certain value chain level a rationale was documented. Reasons for not identifying IROs included, for example, a lack of \nbusiness model relevance or the irrelevance of an ESRS topic for a specific level of the bank’s value chain. The latter was \napplied for ESRS S1 with regards to the bank’s own operations. For the remaining topics IRO statements were created at \nESRS sub-topic and where appropriate sub-sub-topic level based on desk research, expert judgement from the bank’s \nChief Sustainability Office and Subject Matter Experts input. \nIRO evaluation \nDeutsche Bank engaged various internal stakeholders in the DMA process with clearly assigned responsibilities using \ndifferent formats of engagement depending on the process step and maturity of a topic. In general, internal subject matter \nexperts evaluated impact and financial materiality of a topic based on pre-defined IRO statements except for nature-\nrelated as well as human rights-related topics. These topics were discussed in workshops with participants from the bank’s \nNature working group as well as its Human Rights Forum to account for the crosscutting nature and the still evolving \nunderstanding of the topics within the financial sector. Inputs from the workshops were consolidated and transferred to \nthe list of IRO statements. Subject Matter Experts across the bank’s business segments and infrastructure functions were \ninvolved in the evaluation process.  \nDeutsche Bank developed a methodology for evaluating impact and financial materiality based on the characteristics of \nseverity and likelihood. In line with ESRS 1, the bank considered the factors scale, scope to determine the severity of \nimpacts. For negative impacts, irremediability of impacts was also taken into account. The evaluation of financial severity \nincluded financial and reputational effects as well as regulatory developments. To the extent possible, the bank applied \nexisting risk management processes and tools. For example, the bank defined qualitative metrics on six-step scales for \nboth severity and likelihood, leveraging the bank’s Non-Financial Risk Management Grid. The bank did not prioritize \nsustainability-related risks over other types of risks but underwent the relevant materiality assessment processes to \ndetermine the risk management approach to be followed. The bank applied its DMA methodology to both ESRS and entity-\nspecific topics. \nValidation of results \nTo determine the preliminary results of the assessment the bank translated the qualitative evaluations into quantitative \nscores. The materiality threshold was set at 3 minimum on a five-point scale, including a materiality threshold corridor of \n1.5 to 3.  \nTo provide a broader spectrum of perspectives on the materiality of topics for Deutsche Bank, the bank engaged with \nexternal stakeholders, including clients, investors, a non-governmental organization focusing on the financial sector as \nwell as representatives from business associations. Furthermore, the preliminary results of the assessment were discussed \nin structured validation interviews with seven senior validation managers concentrating on topics positioned in the \nmateriality threshold corridor. Ultimately, the final set of material topics was determined by bank experts from the Chief \nSustainability Office taking into account the majority opinion derived from the validation interviews. In a further step, the \nbank verified whether the inherent risks identified under its DMA would also be considered material from the perspective \nof residual risks. Deutsche Bank did not identify any business activities, business relationships, products or services that \nwould be associated with potential significant non-financial residual risks, which were highly likely to have or will in future \nhave a severe negative impact on material non-financial topics.  \n \n \n"}

For example, the bank defined clear roles and responsibilities for each process \nstep, applied the four-eye principle and conducted content-related and plausibility checks by the Chief Sustainability \nOffice. The sign-off process involves senior managers and various governance bodies of the bank to ensure adequate \noversight of the DMA result. First, Senior Confirmation Officers formally signed-off the evaluation results for topics under \ntheir remit. Second, the bank’s Group Sustainability Committee, which acts as the bank’s main governance and decision-\nmaking body for sustainability-related matters, approved the final set of material topics. Finally, the materiality results \nwere presented to and approved by the Management Board and the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.  \nStakeholder views \nIn addition to the bank’s stakeholder dialog on the results of the DMA, the views and interests of users of the Sustainability \nStatement as well as affected stakeholder are indirectly reflected in the IRO evaluation by Subject Matter Experts and in \nthe interviews with Senior Validation Managers. For example, Subject Matter Experts from the bank's business segments \nare expected to reflect clients’ views and interests on sustainability topics. Investors’ views were considered in the \nvalidation interview with Investor Relations.  \nMaterial sustainability topics 2024 \nThe materiality heatmap below shows the results of Deutsche Bank’s DMA 2024. All topics/sub-topics displayed are \nmaterial from an impact and/or financial materiality perspective. However, the dimensions driving materiality can differ \ndepending on the topic. This is indicated by the color coding which is derived from the scores of the IRO statements \nevaluated across the four dimensions: positive and negative impacts, risk and opportunities and the levels of the value \nchain. Dark blue fields indicate that the respective dimension met the materiality threshold. Dimensions, which are shown \nin medium blue, fell into the materiality threshold corridor and were determined as material as a result of the validation \ninterviews. The light blue dimensions have been assessed as non-material with a score below 1.5. While the topics of ESRS \nE2 Pollution, ESRS E3 Water and marine resources as well as ESRS E4 Biodiversity and ecosystems did not reach the bank’s \nmateriality threshold in 2024, the bank is aware of the growing importance of nature-related topics. As part of its \nsustainability strategy, the bank is further developing its approach to the topics Nature and Biodiversity. \nIn 2024, Deutsche Bank aligned the definitions and names of potential material topics with ESRS specifications. \nConsequently, the names of material topics which are outlined in the heatmap below can deviate from the material topics \ndisclosed in the bank’s Non-Financial Report 2023.

Sustainability has been a central part of the bank’s strategy since July 2019. \nSustainability forms one of the three thematic pillars that underpin Deutsche Bank’s corporate strategy, along with macro-\neconomic shifts and technology.  \nThe bank has embedded sustainability into its governance and operations as well as in its products and services, focusing \non four pillars: Sustainable Finance, Policies & Commitments, People & Own Operations and Thought Leadership & \nStakeholder Engagement.  \nWith progress along these four pillars, Deutsche Bank aims to accomplish a significant contribution to achieving the Paris \nClimate Agreement’s targets and the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals. While the bank aims to support \nall 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals, nine of them are closely linked to its sustainability strategy pillars. Furthermore, \nthe bank evaluates to what extent its financing and issuance activities contribute to 15 Sustainable Development Goals in \nline with Deutsche Bank's Sustainable Finance Framework. More information can be found in the “Sustainable Finance” \nchapter within this Sustainability Statement. \nDeutsche Bank’s sustainability strategy aims to continuously improve across environment, social and governance \ndimensions. This has been recognized by leading ESG rating agencies in 2024 (see page “Sustainability” in this \nSustainability Statement), indicating progress across all three dimensions. As an example, the S&P Corporate Sustainability \nAssessment (CSA) score improved in 2024 – and in particular with regard to the approach to human capital as part of the \nsocial category. Consequently, Deutsche Bank was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index Europe and Global. \nSimilarly, the MSCI result shows advancements in employee related KPIs.

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 240, "text": " \n208 \nDeutsche Bank  \nGeneral information \nAnnual Report 2024 \nSustainability strategy \nEnvironmental \nAs a global bank, Deutsche Bank is committed to support and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon sustainable \neconomy. Addressing climate change and environmental destruction necessitates substantial investments as well as a \nprudent risk management approach and presents a significant business opportunity. The bank’s clients have high demands \nfor advice on financial products and services to progress on their individual transformation.  \nIn response to this demand, a central pillar of Deutsche Bank’s environmental strategy is to facilitate sustainable financing \nand ESG investments. The bank aims to achieve a total of € 500 billion in cumulative volumes from January 2020 to end of \n2025 (excluding DWS). By year-end 2024, Deutsche Bank reached € 373 billion (excluding DWS). In 2024, the volumes \nincreased by 46% compared to the previous year. Most of the transactions had an environmental focus, with € 156 billion \nof the cumulative volumes specifically categorized as environmental. For additional information on DWS sustainability and \nsustainable finance and ESG investments strategy, please refer to the “DWS sustainability strategy” section in this chapter \nand the “Sustainable Finance” chapter in this Sustainability Statement. \nThe strategic process behind Deutsche Bank’s sustainable finance business has been continuously enhanced and refined \nover the years. While central coordination resides with the strategy team in the Chief Sustainability Office, each business \ndivision has a specialized ESG team which concentrates on sustainable finance and ESG investments. More details can be \nfound in the “Sustainable Finance” chapter in this Sustainability Statement.  \nDeutsche Bank has established various frameworks. This constitutes the second pillar of its sustainability strategy: Policies \n& Commitments. It includes the bank’s Sustainable Finance Framework, Sustainable Instruments Framework and the ESG \nInvestments Framework. These frameworks set rules around providing sustainable finance as well as products and are \ncontinuously being developed further. For instance, its Sustainable Finance Framework and ESG Investments Framework \ndefine the methodology and procedures for classifying transactions as sustainable. All of them are publicly available and \nwere updated, broadened, or implemented in 2024 as further explained in the “Sustainable finance” chapter of this \nSustainability Statement. Moreover, the development of a Transition Finance Framework will be of strategic importance in \n2025.  \nIn addition to the frameworks, sector guidelines play an important role in Deutsche Bank’s sustainability strategy. In 2024, \nall these guidelines were consolidated into a single policy, owned by the Chief Sustainability Office.  \nThe other cornerstone of the Policies & Commitments pillar is its target to achieve net-zero emissions. The bank’s initial \nTransition Plan, published in October 2023, outlines the strategy to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. The plan focuses \non reducing carbon emissions in three key areas: the bank’s own operations (Scope 1 and 2, including DWS), its supply \nchain (Scope 3, Categories 1 to 14) and the financed emissions associated with the global corporate lending portfolios and \nEuropean residential mortgages (Scope 3, Category 15). Further information can be found in the “Climate change” chapter \nin this Sustainability Statement.  \nWhile Deutsche Bank wants to lead by example in the decarbonization of its own operations, partnering with its \nclients to support them on the path toward net-zero is the main lever for decarbonizing its financing activities and \nthus contributing to the transition of the wider economy. This requires a continuous assessment of its clients and \nintensive engagements with them. Here, Deutsche Bank pursues a three-pronged approach: (1) assisting companies \nthat enable emission reduction, (2) supporting them to transition their business models and (3) phasing out business \nwith not-to-abate industries such as thermal coal.  \nIn addition, Deutsche Bank aims to support its clients in their effort to integrate nature-related aspects into their activities \n– be it via relevant indicators or solutions that support the protection of nature, known as nature-based solutions. Deutsche \nBank has an advisory panel compromised of independent external thought leaders specializing in nature challenges. The \npanel’s role is to provide guidance on how the bank can focus its business more on financing conservation and nature-\nbased solutions.  \nAn additional example is Deutsche Bank’s commitment to the #BackBlue initiative, which aims to ensure that ocean \nprotection is incorporated in finance and insurance decisions. In the reporting year 2024, the elaboration on nature-\nrelated aspects is not presented in detail in this Sustainability Statement as they have not yet exceeded the bank’s \nmateriality threshold.  \n \n \n"}

Here, Deutsche Bank’s data \nand technology capabilities play a vital role. It is essential to ensure the quality, availability and standardization of \nsustainability-related data. Consequently, Deutsche Bank has developed a systematic approach to capturing, \nvalidating and aggregating data, while also exploring technology initiatives that enhance data integration into \nreporting, analysis, planning and monitoring systems. The bank also engages with peers and industry bodies to \ndevelop standardized approaches.  \nMoreover, the People & Own Operations pillar is about enabling employees to participate in the bank’s sustainability \njourney. A key aspect of this is an active communication approach. The Sustainability Hub, an internal information \nplatform, several regular updates from the Chief Sustainability Office as well as business and infrastructure areas \ncontribute to this. Additional examples are regional sustainability-related trainings along with business individual \ntraining formats such as Private Bank’s dedicated sustainability training series in 2024 with 33 sessions for all \nemployees in the Private Bank Germany or dedicated trainings on climate risks across the Investment Bank. \nFurther aspects of the People & Own Operations pillar like Human Rights or Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are \ncovered in the “Social” section of this chapter. \nDeutsche Bank uses its voice and expertise for supporting the deep transformation to a less resource intense \neconomy. This manifests through the fourth strategic pillar: Thought Leadership & Stakeholder Engagement. In 2024, \nthe bank participated at the Climate Week New York and the UN Conference of the Parties (COP). Additionally, it \nhosted a Climate and Security Day in London and became supporter of the Global Investor Commission on Mining \n2030.  \nDeutsche Bank has set the following key targets and goals to environmental related matters:  \n– The bank aims to achieve cumulative sustainable financing and ESG investment volumes of € 500 billion in the period \nfrom January 2020 to end of 2025 (excluding DWS) \n– Deutsche Bank is committed to reduce its CO2 emissions (Scope 1 to 3) to net-zero by 2050Therefore, the bank has set \nnet-zero targets for the eight most carbon-intensive sectors in its corporate loan book by end of 2030 (interim) and end \nof 2050 (final) and linked the Management Board compensation to adherence to these pathways \n– The bank aims to encourage as many of its high-emitting clients in the most carbon-intensive sectors to commit to net-\nzero. However, due to alternating dynamics internationally with regards to net-zero commitments, the bank no longer \nbelieves it is realistic to achieve the ambition of 90% from 2026 onwards. Nevertheless, Deutsche Bank will report \nannually on the progress regarding this ambition \n– Deutsche Bank aims to implement and publish its Transition Finance Framework in 2025 \nIn 2024, Deutsche Bank continued to deliver on its environmental dimension. Key achievements include: \n– The bank achieved a cumulative sustainable financing and ESG investments volume of € 373 billion from the beginning \nof 2020 to end of 2024, with 42% related to environmental activities \n– Deutsche Bank agreed on an additional sectorial emission reduction target for Aviation  \n– The bank communicated that part of the Management Board compensation in the Long-Term Award for 2024 will be \nlinked to adherence to the sector target pathways for carbon-intensive sectors (Scope 3, Category 15) \n– Deutsche Bank strengthened its ocean protection policies as part of its commitment to the #BackBlue initiative  \nSocial  \nIn addition to transitioning to a low-carbon sustainable economy, Deutsche Bank has integrated social aspects into its \nstrategy. This includes the social dimension of sustainable finance and ESG investments volumes, adherence to human \nrights, the promotion of a diverse and qualified workforce, adequate working conditions, and a strong focus on client \ncentricity.  \nBy year-end 2024, at least € 46 billion of the bank’s total € 373 billion volumes in sustainable finance and ESG investments \nwere categorized as social, while € 91 billion were related to both, environmental and social activities (excluding DWS). \nDeutsche Bank has underlined the importance by issuing its inaugural social bond of € 500 million in July 2024. This was \nmade possible by expanding the existing Green Instruments Framework to include social criteria to form the Sustainable \nInstruments Framework.  \n \n \n"}

While \nthe volume of social investments is smaller than environmental investments, Deutsche Bank keeps strengthening its social \nfinancing activities, particularly in support of social housing and just transition in regard to the Global South. These social \nfinancing activities should involve nature-based solutions in the future, which aim to protect both indigenous communities \nand the environment. An example is Deutsche Bank’s involvement in the Indonesia Just Energy Transition Partnership. \nNext to Deutsche Bank’s financing activities, the respect for human rights is an important part of the social strategy – as \npart of its Policies & Commitments pillar. The bank’s approach to human rights encompasses all areas of its business, \nincluding client transactions, interactions with suppliers and service providers, and the treatment of its employees. The \nbank aims to continuously strengthen its human rights management, particularly in light of the German Supply Chain Due \nDiligence Act and the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). \nAnother important social dimension is the promotion of employees. Their engagement, skills, well-being and dedication \nare vital to clients’ lasting success and financial security. The bank’s people strategy aims to support daily collaboration \nand excellence among employees and managers as well as a fair and attractive working environment. The focus is also on \nthe creation of equal opportunities for all.  \nTo empower its workforce, Deutsche Bank enhances a strong learning culture. This includes customized learning \nopportunities, and a wide variety of training offers across the organization, with average training expenses of € 417 per FTE \nand training hours of 18.3 per employee. Moreover, the bank fosters internal mobility to enable employees to broaden their \nskills and experience. talent acceleration programs help employees to develop both professionally and personally. \nThe bank recognizes leadership as key for workforce excellence and transformation and fosters leadership capabilities \nthrough talent and leadership programs. This includes the newly established All-Managers-Curriculum, centered on the \nbank’s aspirational culture and Leadership Kompass. It aims to promote excellence and an inclusive as well as growth-\noriented mindset. \nDeutsche Bank supports a health-promoting work environment, providing a wide range of benefits and a comprehensive \nsupport network ranging from career advice, mental health support or employee assistance programs. These aim to help \nits employees balance professional and personal commitments. In total, Deutsche Bank operates more than 850 employee \nbenefit plans globally and offers a hybrid working model, allowing to combine the benefits of remote and in-office work.  \nThe bank fosters a diverse workforce, representing employees from 160 nationalities. It promotes the advancement of \nwomen and historically underrepresented groups by embedding diversity, equity, and inclusion in its culture as well as \nworking conditions and creating dedicated development programs. Additionally, training modules, such as Leading \nInclusively, are offered to managers to help them become leaders aware of unconscious bias. Moreover, the bank supports \nemployee-led groups that represent a variety of communities, including LGBTQI+ employees, those from multicultural \nbackgrounds, parents, different generations, and individuals with disabilities or neurodivergence. \nA key indicator of progress in Deutsche Bank’s people strategy is the annual People Survey. The survey centers on \nemployees’ commitment and enablement and encourages feedback on an even wider range of topics, including working \nconditions, sense of purpose and fulfillment at work.  \nIn 2024, the employee commitment decreased to 67%, down from 70% in 2023. The enablement index also saw a slight \ndecline to 70% from 71% in 2023. At the same time, employees’ intrinsic motivation, their willingness to go above and \nbeyond, remains at a very high level, indicative of a high-performance organization. The results from the People Survey \nwere shared with the Management and Supervisory Board. In 2024, the Boards identified four key focus areas for the bank \nto address with targeted initiatives: Strategy and Transformation (e.g., process improvements and better communication), \nLeadership (e.g., manager curricula), Sustainable Career Development (e.g., individual growth), and Performance and \nFeedback (e.g., sustainable performance culture).  \nAdditionally, the bank runs a Culture Pulse survey three times a year to continuously gauge employees’ perceptions of \ntheir workplace. In 2024, the focus has been on feedback and productive behaviors within their working environment.  \nDeutsche Bank has received recognition for its progress, earning awards such as The Times top 50 Employers for Gender \nEquality 2024, the Max-Spohr-Prize 2024 and the recognition at the InsideOut Mental Health Awards 2024 as Financial \nServices Employer of the Year.

Client centricity is fundamental to \nDeutsche Bank’s business and its “This is Deutsche Bank” framework including the bank’s client-centric purpose statement, \n“Dedicated to our clients’ lasting success and financial security at home and abroad”. In addition, client centricity is \ngrounded in four guiding principles that foster the bank’s desired culture. These principles promote a commercial mindset, \nencouraging collaboration throughout the organization to create an excellent client experience.  \nTo enhance client relationships, Deutsche Bank established a Client Centricity Program. This program focuses on three \nkey objectives: (1) driving closer bank-wide collaboration around clients, (2) aligning client data and tools, and (3) improving \nclient resource allocation to drive Shareholder Value Add (SVA). The program is supported by Management Board \nsponsorship, established governance structures, cross-divisional collaboration supported by action plans as well as an \nenhanced incentive framework.  \nTo build trusting relationships with clients, Deutsche Bank aims to sustain and develop products with high-quality \nstandards for all offerings. Business divisions have formulated individual strategies to meet these standards in line with \ntheir specific client group. For instance, the Private Bank employs a divisional multi-client segment strategy to improve \nthe implementation and alignment of the Net Promoter Score (NPS) and client feedback processes across all regions. The \nInvestment Bank Fixed Income & Currencies receives and reviews feedback from institutional clients via broker reviews as \nstructured format or via direct dialogues with clients (e.g., meetings and calls with Deutsche Bank management).  \nDeutsche Bank evaluates a wide range of criteria for the development and continuous improvement of its products and \nservices, including sustainability criteria such as the alignment with its sustainability targets. To ensure the products and \nservices are suitable for the target market and consistent with the bank’s objectives and values, they go through a \ndedicated control process. Deutsche Bank has established robust processes to ensure all products and services meet high-\nquality standards and minimize complaints. Specifically, it established New Product Approval and Systematic Product \nReview processes that form a control framework to manage the risks associated with new products and services as well as \ntheir lifecycle management. Additionally, each business division gathers the mentioned client feedback to assess client \nsatisfaction in ways that are tailored to its specific client group.  \nDeutsche Bank has set the following key targets and goals related to social matters:  \n– It aims to have women representing at least 35% of Managing Director, Director and Vice President roles by year-end \n2025 \n– The bank plans to have at least 32.5% women in the positions one and two levels below the Management Board by the \nend of 2026  \n– Deutsche Bank has set out a target of at least 70% regarding employees’ perception of the bank’s working conditions \nreflected in the Culture Pulse Index \nTo support the advancement of women and members of other groups, the bank embeds diversity, equity, and inclusion in \nits culture and employee practices. It holds leaders accountable using a data-driven approach with strong engagement \nand visible sponsorship from senior management and operationalization at the divisional level. \nIn 2024, Deutsche Bank continued to deliver on its social dimension. Key achievements are:  \n– The bank expanded its Green Instruments Framework to include social criteria to form the Sustainable Instruments \nFramework. This enabled the firm to issue its inaugural social bond of € 500 million with an orderbook size of over \n€ 6.6 billion \n– By year-end 2024, 33% of Managing Director, Director and Vice President were women, which represented an increase \nof 0.7%-pts compared to year-end 2023  \n– The People Survey received the highest participation rate since 2011, with 65% of invited employees.

These processes, policies and frameworks are closely \nmonitored to continuously enhance existing controls in key risk areas. For example, Group Data Privacy defines and \nmaintains internal policy requirements and minimum control standards which the bank’s business and infrastructure units \nmust adhere to, taking into account the latest regulatory developments. An assessment of antitrust, inherent bribery and \ncorruption risks and corresponding controls across all of the bank’s businesses and infrastructure functions is conducted \nannually. Additionally, Deutsche Bank’s Whistleblowing framework sets out the bank’s internal approach for raising \nconcerns. Speaking up and Listening is encouraged as a critical behavior supporting the bank’s aspirational culture. The \nFinancial Crime Risk Management framework offers guidance on the identification and management of financial crime \nrisks.  \nEmployees receive regular training on various governance-related topics, including antitrust risks, anti-financial crime, \ndata protection, information security, and the bank’s speak-up culture. Further mandatory training programs, which are \nrolled out at least once a year via the online e-learning platform, include antitrust training, the Code of Conduct and Your \nSupervisory Duties as a Manager training, focusing on conduct and behavioral aspects.  \nIn 2024, Deutsche Bank established the “This is Deutsche Bank” framework. At the center is the client-centric purpose \nstatement. The framework also encompasses the bank’s vision, strategy, aspirational culture, and claim, promoting a client-\ncentric mindset to achieving targets of the corporate strategy and strengthening the culture. An important part of this \ninitiative is the bank’s Culture program, which focuses on four key guiding principles: “we act responsibly to inspire trust”, \n“we think commercially for sustainable outcomes”, “we take initiative to create solutions”, and “we work collaboratively for \nthe greatest impact”. These principles are further broken down into sixteen specific behaviors such as prioritizing time and \nresources, generating new opportunities and recognizing collective achievements. Part of the activation of the “This is \nDeutsche Bank” framework were ambassador meetings with employees across the organization, along with a \ncomprehensive group-wide communication strategy.  \nDeutsche Bank’s Code of Conduct serves as the foundation for the bank’s purpose. Its aim is to foster a diverse and \ninclusive environment where employees’ opinions are valued and speaking up and raising concerns are encouraged. A \ncollaborative and respectful atmosphere is essential for the success of both employees and the bank in serving clients, \nstakeholders and communities. \nDeutsche Bank is dedicated to collaborating with governments, policymakers, and the industry to improve conditions for \nits clients to thrive and to help them navigate challenges such as geopolitical uncertainties. As part of this, the bank acts \nas an intermediary between clients and policymakers to reinforce a better understanding of both public and private side \nstakeholders, thereby facilitating a more effective and efficient sustainable transition process. This is achieved by \nconveying implementation challenges to the policymakers and clarifying the regulatory intentions behind disclosure and \nreporting requirements to clients. Regarding tax matters, Deutsche Bank seeks to develop and maintain positive working \nrelationships with tax authorities by engaging with them in a proactive, transparent, professional, and timely manner. \nAdditionally, Deutsche Bank continued its existing financial crime risks industry engagements with relevant associations \nsuch as the Wolfsberg Group and has been participating in the German Anti Financial Crime Alliance Board since 2022. \n"}

The bank wants to understand \ntheir expectations and concerns about its strategy, business activities and social responsibilities. This helps the bank \nidentify its potentially positive and negative impacts.  \nDeutsche Bank’s core stakeholders, i.e., those persons or groups of persons identified that can materially affect or be \naffected by the bank, belong to the following groups: clients, employees, investors, regulators and society at large, \nincluding e. g. media and non-governmental organizations. The bank has clearly defined responsibilities towards \nstakeholder engagement. On the one hand the double materiality assessment, which is described in more detail in the \nchapter of the same name in this Sustainability Statement helps identify stakeholder sentiment overarchingly on the topics \nthey regard as most relevant to the bank. Additionally, each business division and infrastructure function have mandates \nfor interaction with their assigned stakeholder group. For material topics in stakeholder interests and for ensuring that their \nfeedback and demands are taken seriously Deutsche Bank has developed respective approaches to address and action \nfeedback and to make sure the material topics are integrated in its business model. For instance, the complaint \nmanagement channel open to the bank’s clients and the whistleblowing channel for its employees enables a more \ncomprehensive feedback capture and analysis process. Themes identified in this process are considered as a valuable input \nfactor for the bank’s regular review and improvement of its business strategies, aiming at better fulfilling stakeholders’ \nneeds and expectations. \nClients \nESRS S4, ESRS 2 SBM-2 \nSustainability has gained significant momentum across all the bank’s client groups. The bank sees it as its responsibility to \nadvise its clients in areas where they are looking for guidance and support for their transformation. Regular dialog helps \nthe bank to understand its clients’ expectations, interests and needs and translate them into action.  \nDeutsche Bank engages with its clients in many ways, including for example, personal or virtual meetings, calls, regular \nsurveys and the analysis of feedback it receives e. g. via its branches or hotlines. Deutsche Bank representatives are \ninvolved in discussions at various conferences and events. The bank also communicates via digital communication \nchannels and publishes papers on sustainability topics.  \nClimate change and the transition of the global economy toward sustainability remained an important topic for clients in \nthe Corporate Bank and Investment Bank as well as investors, keeping the interest in sustainable finance products and \nservices at a high level. Private clients requested best-in-class transparency and sustainability-related advisory. In 2024, \nDeutsche Bank continued to support its clients with its financial expertise and product offerings on their path to \nsustainability. For details on products, see “Sustainable finance” chapter. \nDeutsche Bank also engages in sustainability related initiatives. For example, Private Bank has continued its strategic \npartnerships with organizations such as Ocean Risk and Resilience Action Alliance and World Wildlife Fund for Nature. \nEmployees \nESRS S1, ESRS 2 SBM-2 \nThe ideas and skills as well as the commitment and wellbeing of Deutsche Bank’s employees are essential to a productive \nworkforce. Strong relationships, open communication and learning from feedback are key in fostering a trusting \nenvironment in which employees take accountability and collaborate.  \nThe annual People Survey, exit and pulse surveys as well as a continuous dialogue with its employees help the bank \nunderstand its employees’ motivation and their perceived productivity. Several communication channels including team \nmeetings, employee networks, emails, newsletters, townhalls and the ability to comment on intranet pages encourage the \nbank’s employees to share their thoughts and give feedback.  \nIn 2024, the People Survey showed a decline in the key indicators, employee commitment and enablement. A focus on \nfour key areas, Strategy & Transformation, Leadership, Sustainable Career Development and Performance & Feedback will \nhelp the bank to improve employee effectiveness and remain competitive with other financial services and high performing \ncompanies. \nHow Deutsche Bank manages employee-related aspects is detailed in the “Own Workforce” chapter within the \nSustainability Statement. \n"}

For financing and bond issuance, the \nreporting is based on the flow of new business in the reporting period and cumulated since 2020. The reporting \nmethodology takes the origination role view, which does not necessarily correlate to Deutsche Bank’s balance sheet \ncommitment. The bank’s apportioned sustainable finance volume is determined based on its role in the transaction. For \nthe arranger roles, the bank’s sustainable finance volume is calculated by dividing the overall deal notional value by the \nnumber of total mandated lead arrangers, lead arrangers or arrangers depending on the highest role performed by the \nbank. If Deutsche Bank does not have any of these roles, the bank’s apportioned loan value in the deal is counted toward \nthe sustainable finance target.

As a result, the Private Bank aims to \nprovide its clients with responsible banking and wants to be their trusted partner. It provides differentiated sustainability \nadvice and a broad range of financial services for private and personal banking clients, wealthy individuals, entrepreneurs \nand family associations as well as business clients in selected countries. \nOverview \nESRS 2 MDR-P, ESRS 2 MDR-A, ESRS 2 MDR-M, ESRS 2 SBM-1 \nFinancing \nThe Private Bank offers dedicated sustainability lending and financing options for its clients. Lending volumes are reported \nas sustainable only if they meet either the environmental or social criteria. In Germany, the Private Bank has continued, to \nexpand products and services across all brands facilitating homeowners to meet EU requirements on energy efficiency.  \nThe Private Bank in Germany offers its customers a comprehensive sustainability product package through BHW \nBausparkasse AG (BHW AG), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. This includes a “climate loan” with special conditions as well \nas other services, such as real estate agents, energy efficiency experts, funding services and craftsmen placement. With \nits “Modernization made easy” advisory service, BHW is positioning itself as a platform for the decarbonization of the \nconstruction financing portfolio in Germany. \nIn addition to lending options for German retail clients, the Private Bank offers its Wealth Management clients, sustainable \nlending options for commercial real estate, prime residential real estate and for certain private investment vehicles held \nby clients, investing for example in clean energy. The Private Bank also supports companies in achieving their sustainability \ngoals, for example through loans for electric vehicles and green mortgages for the purchase of houses with energy \nefficiency classes in the top 15% of local markets, as well as through loans for micro-enterprises in India. \nInvestments \nIn line with the Group’s ESG Investments Framework, Private Bank applies the following approaches to investment \nproducts.  \nDiscretionary portfolio management uses MSCI data to exclude certain industries in accordance with the bank’s Group \nESG Investments Framework and the portfolios’ underlying securities must have a minimum MSCI ESG rating. In line with \nregional regulatory requirements, discretionary portfolio management also includes attributes that align the instrument \nselection within its mandates and wrapped funds to the regulatory defined sustainability characteristics. Discretionary \nportfolio management offers sustainable solutions across the main regions and in 2024, sales efforts were also increased \nby further extending the fixed income offering in response to client demand for the asset class. Also, the Strategic Asset \nAllocation offering was extended in 2024 to private and personal banking clients in Germany. \nFunds on Private Bank’s advisory list are assessed by Global Funds Research to assess if they meet minimum requirements \nto be considered as an ESG fund. ESG funds must have a qualifying ESG strategy, meet a minimum MSCI ESG rating and \nalign to defined sustainability regulations within the applicable region. Additional and periodic due diligence is carried out \nto determine the intentionality of the ESG strategy of the fund before it is actively promoted in advisory processes as ESG. \nIn 2024, the Global Funds Research team continued their efforts to assess ESG funds through active search for viable \nofferings in sub asset classes. The number of ESG funds meeting the defined criteria on Private Bank’s recommended lists \nremained almost unchanged at 55 mutual funds and 109 exchange-traded funds (2023: 56 mutual funds, 118 exchange-\ntraded funds).  \nThe classification of alternatives follows the defined minimum standards described above for funds with additional due \ndiligence carried out to determine the intentionality of the ESG strategy of the product before it is actively promoted in \nadvisory processes as ESG and included in the ESG AuM volumes. The second ESG alternative fund was offered in the third \nquarter on clean energy transition for wealth management clients after the first ESG alternative fund was offered in 2023.  \nThe ESG approach for capital markets instruments is to align with the International Capital Market Association’s (ICMA) \nGreen Bond Principles. Consequently, third party green-, social and sustainability-linked bonds offered to wealth \nmanagement clients are considered ESG instruments if they meet all four core components of ICMA, which are use of \nproceeds, disclosure of the process for project evaluation and selection, the management of the proceeds and annual \nreporting on allocations. \n"}

This applies to the financing \nof residential properties in Germany that are either newly built, purchased for the first time, or renovated in compliance \nwith certain energy efficiency requirements.  \nMicro enterprise loans in India enable Private Bank to offer products to small firms that would otherwise not receive \nfinancing, with some loans backed by government schemes. Up to the end of 2024, 2,771 term loans and revolving credit \nfacilities with a total volume of € 361 million have been provided to micro and small enterprise clients.  \nAcknowledging the long-term importance of the strategic asset allocation on the risk and return profile of a client portfolio, \nDeutsche Bank ESG Strategic Asset Allocation (“SAA”) fund offering was extended in 2024 to private and personal banking \nclients in Germany. Following continued client demand in 2024, the Private Bank continued its sales efforts in the fixed \nincome space and complemented the offering with two new Euro fixed income funds. \nIn 2024, the Private Bank launched its second ESG alternative fund for wealth management which offers investments into \nclean energy transition opportunities, recognizing the role of private market assets.

Responsible investing has been a key part of DWS’s heritage for more than twenty years. \nESG Assets under Management \nBased on DWS’s global ESG Framework, the following products were considered as ESG Assets under Management (AuM) \nas at the end of 2024: \n– Liquid actively managed products: retail mutual funds which follow the “DWS ESG Investment Standard” filter, or have \na “sustainable investment objective” and U.S. mutual funds which have been labelled as ESG and seek to adhere to an \nESG investment strategy  \n– Xtrackers ETFs which apply a screen comparable to the “DWS ESG Investment Standard” filter, or which track indices \nthat comply with the EU Benchmark regulation on EU Climate Transition Benchmarks and EU Paris-Aligned \nBenchmarks, or have a “sustainable investment objective” and other liquid passively managed funds which have been \nlabelled as ESG and/or seek to adhere to an ESG investment strategy  \n– Liquid mandates or special funds for institutional clients or White Label products in-scope of the EU Sustainable Finance \nDisclosure Regulation (SFDR) and that report pursuant to Article 8 SFDR which follow the “DWS ESG Investment \nStandard” filter or a comparable ESG filter aligned with the client or which are in-scope of SFDR and report pursuant to \nArticle 9 SFDR \n– Liquid mandates or special funds for institutional clients or White Label products which are out-of-scope of SFDR but \ncomply with certain of the “General Industry Standards and Guidelines for Sustainable Investing”  \n– Illiquid products which are in-scope of SFDR and that report pursuant to Article 9 SFDR \n– Illiquid products which are out-of-scope of SFDR but which have a “sustainable investment objective” \nMost of DWS´s European domiciled actively managed retail funds continue to apply one of two DWS ESG filters: “DWS \nESG Investment Standard” or “DWS Basic Exclusions”:  \n– The “DWS Basic Exclusions” filter represents DWS´s basic approach to incorporating certain exclusions in the \ninvestment policy of the relevant fund; products applying this filter only are excluded from the 2024 ESG AuM number  \n– The “DWS ESG Investment Standard” filter enhances the exclusions in comparison to the “DWS Basic Exclusion” filter; \nproducts applying this filter are included in the 2024 ESG AuM number \nESG Assets under Management (AuM) \nin € bn.1 \nDec 31, 2024 \nDec 31, 2023 \nTotal ESG AuM (according to the DWS ESG Framework) \n163 \n133 \n \n1 Numbers may not add up due to rounding \nThe € 29 billion increase in ESG AuM was primarily driven by market movements and net flows. DWS reports ESG AuM to \nprovide transparency around the proportion of its investments that meet the DWS ESG definition. This was accompanied \nby an ambition applicable during the reporting year of 2024 to continue to grow DWS ESG AuM through a combination of \nflows into existing products, flows into new products and supporting the transfer by existing clients of their assets from \nnon-ESG products into ESG products. \nGiven the influence of market movements and other variables DWS did not set a specific quantitative target for this metric. \nDWS will continue to monitor the external and regulatory environment in the context of its approach to reporting products \nmanaged in relation to environmental, social or governance characteristics. \nLiquid assets  \nIn the Active business, sustainability risks and opportunities are considered at various steps of the respective investment \nprocesses, such as in fundamental issuer analysis and portfolio management.

DWS Real Estate focuses on the following ESG aspects, which \nare material for real estate equity and/or debt investments: transitional (e.g., building’s energy efficiency), physical (e.g., \nflooding risk), social norms (e.g., wellbeing sustainability rating) and governance (e.g., third-party risk rating of a debt \nsponsor). These ESG aspects can present both risks and opportunities for the financial performance of real estate assets \nand investments may have positive and negative environmental and social effects. Therefore, DWS Real Estate takes a \nfiduciary-led approach to ESG aspects and sustainability performance in private real estate investment management, \ndefining a range of operation between ESG and financial risk boundaries. The ESG risk boundary relates to risks where \nappropriate actions to assess and manage ESG aspects, if not undertaken in good time, could result in negative impacts \non sustainability and long-term expected financial performance of the asset or portfolio. The financial risk boundary relates \nto negative effects of inappropriate sustainability actions (e.g., actions that are ill-timed, or too extensive) on compliance \nwith the investment objectives. \n \n \n"}

Sustainable building certifications offer a holistic \nassessment and rating of real estate assets’ performance, sustainability topics relevant for real estate and captured in \nsustainability themes. The investment process comprises three phases: research and strategy, portfolio planning and \nexecution. ESG aspects and sustainability performance are important elements of consideration in each phase, which \nincludes both risks and opportunities analyses. Sustainability due diligence is completed prior to acquisition and delivered \nthrough two screening phases: initial and advanced screening, assessing, among other factors, the asset’s resilience to \nboth transitional and physical risks. The findings are presented to the investment committee and include found issues, \nnecessary actions and underwriting. \nFollowing acquisition, asset and portfolio managers monitor sustainability performance not only to ensure proper risk \nmitigation but also to actively seek opportunities to add value as part of ongoing business planning. For equity investments, \nthe annual asset sustainability action plan is based on achieved performance and consequent asset and portfolio risk \nprofile review, portfolio investment plan including asset holding period and portfolio sustainability strategy objectives. \nInfrastructure \nDWS seeks to incorporate environmental considerations into the infrastructure business investment framework at all \nstages of the investment lifecycle for equity investments – from the initial screening and due diligence to the asset \nmanagement and exit stages. The infrastructure business engages with portfolio company management on ESG to discuss \nDWS’s ESG objectives and reporting with respect to the portfolio company. A set of KPIs for each portfolio company is \nidentified, agreed and tracked regularly. During the holding period, DWS monitors environmental attributes such as carbon \nfootprint and water usage of the investments through the regular reporting of KPIs by portfolio companies and through \ncompletion of the annual Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) Infrastructure benchmarking assessment \nat both fund and asset level. Due diligence includes climate-related considerations and is incorporated into the Investment \nCommittee paper and presented to the Investment Committee for consideration.  \nThe infrastructure business also produces an annual Sustainable and Responsible Investment report for investors in each \nof its funds. This report addresses various ESG initiatives and performance for the fund’s underlying investments and in \n2024 the report included information aligned with the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures \nrecommendations (TFCD) for each investment.  \nDuring 2024 DWS updated the Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS) under which the business operates \nto reflect changes in the ESG environment and to strengthen procedures. The ESMS has also been updated to reflect \nDWS’s obligations under the SFDR and investor requirements. It applies to potential and existing portfolio investments in \ninfrastructure equity. The ESMS also creates obligations on all portfolio companies to ensure regular engagement and \nreporting on ESG matters, resulting in driving improvements in ESG metrics and performance and creating a framework for \nregular reporting to DWS.  \nThe Infrastructure Debt business uses a bespoke proprietary ESG scoring methodology, which has been rolled out to new \nand existing investments since 2021. The methodology supports the overall investment process and ongoing monitoring \nof environmental risks of the infrastructure debt portfolios among other ESG risks. \nThe infrastructure business ensures skills and competencies are maintained in accordance with the needs of DWS to \nproperly implement its ESG policies and operate its ESMS effectively through the implementation of its competency and \ntraining matrix. \n \n \n"}

Through the Unit RRAP relevant stakeholders are consulted for input, \nsuch as country management, key control functions and other second-line subject matter experts. The Unit RRAP is \nchaired by a business division’s relevant senior manager and applies to all matters deemed to pose moderate or greater \nreputational risk.  \nIf a matter is considered to pose a material reputational risk and/or meets one of the bank’s mandatory referral criteria, it \nis referred to the relevant Regional Reputational Risk Committee for further review.

At the day-to-day level, this involves implementation of environmental and social requirements for transactions \nand/or clients particularly in sectors with elevated environmental and social risk as internally defined, as well as conducting \nrobust due diligence. At a strategic level, to ensure that Deutsche Bank policies remain effective and aligned with the \nevolving market best practices and also are robust enough to manage the ever changing environmental and social risks \nfaced by Financial Institutions, the Group Sustainability function within the Chief Sustainability Office is responsible for \ndesigning standards and policies for environmental and social due diligence. To ensure the effectiveness of the guidelines, \ntraining is also provided to relevant employees to reinforce their awareness and focus. Since 2022, the team is expanding \nits presence and as of 2024 is based in Frankfurt, London, Singapore, Mumbai, New York and Washington.  \nBuilding up on the provisions in force since 2016 and tightened in 2020, Deutsche Bank updated its thermal coal guideline \nin March 2023. This guideline applies to thermal coal power and mining clients. The bank tightened the criteria when a \ncompany is deemed a thermal coal company and in scope of the guideline, as well as specified the requirements to be \napplied to clients in scope of the updated guideline. For instance, the revenue threshold according to which a corporate \nclient is regarded to be a thermal coal company has been lowered from a revenue dependency of 50% to 30%. In addition, \nnew absolute thermal coal production thresholds of 10 megatons per year for thermal coal production and 10 gigawatts \nfor thermal coal power capacity have been introduced. For clients to access baseline funding, the bank requires credible \ntransition plans from companies in scope of the updated thermal coal guideline. Existing clients are required to present \nsuch plans in 2025, while for new clients such plans are a precondition for any lending.  \nThroughout 2024, the bank also performed a portfolio review to identify and assess clients in-scope of the thermal coal \nguideline The aim of this portfolio review was to establish an understanding of in-scope clients and their transition plans \nby 2025. The results from the portfolio review support Deutsche Bank in its client engagements, particularly around the \ndevelopment of credible transition plans where necessary. \nDeutsche Bank has a dedicated Nature work stream which aims to broaden and improve the banks environmental and \nsocial minimum positions around nature risks. In 2024, Deutsche Bank enhanced its due diligence requirements related to \nocean protection. This update is a continuation of its commitment to the #BackBlue initiative. Deutsche Bank became in \n2023 the first bank to join #BackBlue – a commitment led by Deutsche Bank’s partner Ocean Risk and Resilience Action \nAlliance (ORRAA) and backed by the United Nations. Under this initiative, Deutsche Bank aims at working on developing \nfinancial solutions supporting ocean protection. The development of the new ocean protection due diligence requirements \nhas been guided by international frameworks such as the Sustainable Blue Economy Finance Principles hosted by the \nUnited Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). The key changes under the ocean-related guideline \nupdate are: \n– A new guideline on maritime transport and infrastructure which includes provisions to monitor compliance with the \nenvironmental and social conventions of the United Nations and its specialized agencies International Maritime \nOrganization (IMO) and International Labour Organization (ILO) \n– Exclusions and due diligence provisions to ensure stronger protection of sensitive marine areas and critical habitats \n– Expansion of the already existing fisheries guideline to include new due diligence requirements for marine aquaculture \n– Considering current gaps in regulation and science-based understanding of the impact of deep-sea mining, direct \nfinance of deep-sea mining projects has been prohibited \nThe work of nature workstream will continue in 2025 amongst others with focus on deforestation. \n \n \n"}

The \nEquator Principles are an internationally recognized benchmark for determining, assessing and managing environmental \nand social risks in project-related finance.  \nAs a signatory to the Equator Principles, the bank applies the risk identification, assessment, management and reporting \nrequirements of the principles to in-scope project-related finance transactions. In line with Deutsche Bank’s environmental \nand social due diligence requirements, the bank’s business units are initially responsible for identifying environmental and \nsocial risks, determining if a transaction falls into the Equator Principles scope and gathering due diligence documentation. \nTo support business units, internal Equator Principles implementation guidance and trainings were developed which \nspecify the requirements for project categorization (A, B or C), due diligence and guidance on referral to Group \nSustainability. Group Sustainability is responsible for assisting business units in assessing environmental and social issues \nand associated risks. For eligible projects, Group Sustainability either conducts an in-house review of project \ndocumentation during due diligence and monitoring phases, or requests an independent external consultant for higher-\nrisk projects, as required by the Equator Principles. The due diligence process and post-transactional monitoring involves \ndiscussions of critical issues with clients and tracking of remediation actions.

As this subject is a significant \npart of the bank’s entire organization and has exposure to a variety of ESRS requirements the chapter includes all material \ndisclosures pertaining to the cross-cutting standard ESRS 2, and the topical standard ESRS G1. \nThe way in which Deutsche Bank procures products and services has a significant influence on its sustainability footprint. \nFor this reason, Global Procurement plays a key role in delivering the bank’s supply chain related sustainability \ncommitments. Whilst individual divisions are accountable for the suppliers they select and the associated risk, the Global \nProcurement function leads the selection of suppliers with an annual spend greater than or equal to € 500,000. \nPart of the Global Procurement function, the Supply Chain Sustainability team focuses on promoting and embedding \nsustainability within the bank’s upstream value chain. Its core objectives are aligned with the bank’s corporate strategy \nwhich establishes transparency and accountability not only in corporate practices but also throughout the supplier \nlifecycle process. This approach supports the bank’s commitment to sustainable procurement practices and enhances the \noverall resilience of the supply chain.  \nGovernance \nESRS 2 GOV-2 \nDeutsche Bank’s management board has oversight of key supply chain sustainability initiatives and receives updates on \nprogress against established goals as required. The Chief Procurement Officer is tasked with integrating supply chain \nsustainability into procurement practices while working closely with the Chief Sustainability Officer to align with Deutsche \nBank’s overall sustainability strategy.  \nDeutsche Bank has a Supply Chain Sustainability governance body to promote and integrate sustainable practices across \nsupplier lifecycle process, to ensure that sustainability considerations are balanced and aligned with the Deutsche Bank’s \npurpose. This comprises experts across Global Procurement with the objective of fostering knowledge and best practice \nto encourage adoption of responsible practices, enhancing transparency and traceability, and aligning supply chain efforts \nwith Deutsche Bank’s broader sustainability strategy and goals.  \nThe Third-Party Environment, Social and Governance Oversight Forum provides leadership and guidance on third-party \nsustainability risk related topics across the bank. The Forum comprises representatives from Non-Financial Risk \nManagement, Legal, Global Procurement and the Chief Sustainability Office and meets regularly to ensure an aligned \noversight and decision-making. \nStrategy \nESRS 2 SBM-3 \nDeutsche Bank’s supply chain sustainability strategy focuses on integrating sustainability factors into the end-to-end \nsupplier lifecycle process. This aligns with the bank’s broader commitment to sustainability.  \nTo underscore the bank’s commitment to sustainability and its responsiveness to evolving standards, Deutsche Bank \nincreased the ESG score threshold for suppliers with a volume greater than or equal € 500,000 per annum from 25 to 45 \nout of 100 on the EcoVadis scoring scale (or the equivalent score from other approved rating agencies – such as MSCI, \nSustainalytics, ISS, S&P, CDP) for its suppliers to enhance its focus on a structured and proactive approach to sustainability. \nThis was implemented in 2024 to encourage suppliers to attain enhanced standards of environmental, social and \ngovernance performance, to support delivery of evolving best practices and regulations in sustainability and to drive \npositive impact throughout the value chain. \nIn addition, the two material topics identified through the materiality assessment are integrated into Deutsche Bank’s \nsupply chain sustainability strategy as outlined in the following sub-chapter. \n \n \n"}

The materiality assessment of upstream-related impacts, risks and opportunities is limited to the bank’s \ndirect suppliers. \nTwo material topics were identified as critical to the bank’s supply chain sustainability efforts: \n– Climate change: Addressing and pursuing efforts to reduce or prevent emission of greenhouse gases throughout the \nsupply chain \n– Business conduct: Management of relationships with suppliers including payment practices and information security \nPolicies and standards \nDeutsche Bank group-wide (excl. DWS) Procurement Policy sets minimum requirements for the procurement of goods and \nservices from third party external suppliers. The Chief Procurement Officer is accountable for the implementation of the \npolicy which is reviewed at least annually and accessible to employees through the Policy Portal. \nDeutsche Bank has a Supplier Code of Conduct and monitors supplier acknowledgements to the core values and standards \nof behavior that Deutsche Bank expects its suppliers to conform to when providing goods and services. The Supplier Code \nof Conduct lies within the responsibility of the Head of Procurement Enablement & Transformation. It explains the bank’s \nexpectations of suppliers on key thematic areas and continues to be updated to reflect evolving requirements such as \ncompliance and human rights. \nStakeholder engagement and collaboration \nDelivering the bank’s sustainability objectives is achieved through cross-functional collaboration with internal \nstakeholders as well as partnerships within the supply chain. The bank actively promotes sustainability in its supply chain \nby providing training and awareness sessions on current and emerging sustainability topics. This ensures stakeholders are \nwell-informed about the key controls embedded in the supplier lifecycle process and their role in supporting Deutsche \nBank to achieve its sustainability goals. Furthermore, Deutsche Bank fosters collaboration with its strategic suppliers \nthrough regular governance meetings aimed at encouraging cooperation on sustainability initiatives, facilitating open \ncommunication and aligning goals between the bank and its suppliers. \nClimate change \nDecarbonization in the supply chain \nAs part of its ongoing commitment to reduce the environmental impact of suppliers, the bank is an active participant in \nthe Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Supply Chain program, where members can engage with the suppliers to identify risks \nand opportunities and share carbon emissions data. In 2023, Deutsche Bank published an Initial Transition Plan which \noutlines what the bank’s overall approach to decarbonization looks like and the journey towards realizing net-zero. In 2024, \nDeutsche Bank expanded the scope of suppliers asked to share CDP data from 240 in the previous year to 400 suppliers. \nThese represent 74% of the total supplier spend and are therefore critical in supporting Deutsche Bank realizing its net-\nzero ambition. \nWhile Deutsche Bank has not formally joined the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), Deutsche Bank has adopted SBTi \ntargets and as such, commits to a reduction in operational Scope 3 emission (excluding financed emission – Category 15) \nof 46% by 2030 compared to the 2019 baseline, equivalent to 4.3% per year. \nBusiness conduct  \nSupplier selection and contracting  \nDeutsche Bank places a significant emphasis on supplier selection and managing the relationships with suppliers that have \nbeen selected to ensure efficient operations and compliance with regulatory standards.  \nESG clauses are embedded into applicable contracts for suppliers in scope to acknowledge that environmental, social and \ncorporate governance is critical for Deutsche Bank in procuring the services and obligates them to maintain a valid external \nsustainability assessment from an eligible rating agency as mentioned above, that meets or exceeds the minimum rating \nscore.

Contingency plans are in place to address potential disruption in the supply chain, ensuring continuity \nof services and minimizing risks. In addition, third-party screening is performed irrespective of the materiality, inherent risk \nand outsourcing classification of the service. Screening activities cover the financial stability and due diligence (Sanctions \nand Embargoes, Internal Watch List, Adverse Media, Politically Exposed Persons) checks which enables Deutsche Bank to \ngain insight into the Third Parties’ risk profile. If required, screening results are escalated to respective risk type control \nfunction for further investigation. \nPayment practices \nPayment terms and conditions are clearly outlined in the contracts between Deutsche Bank and its suppliers in alignment \nwith governing laws on payment terms. Deutsche Bank contractual payment term standards for individual contracts aim \nfor 60 days for Europe and 90 days for the rest of the world. These standards typically apply to suppliers providing products \nor services to the bank with a value greater than € 100,000 per annum. Other suppliers of DB, especially any EU \ntransactions in connection with general purchasing terms and conditions are paid on payment terms up to 30 days, unless \nthere is a contract in place stating otherwise. Where local jurisdictions require specific payment terms, Deutsche Bank acts \naccordingly. Appropriate templates and processes are in place to procure that new suppliers are set up with correct \npayment terms.  \nInformation security \nDependency on third-party products and services can expose the bank to cyber risks and impact its risk posture, as these \ncan be prime targets for information security attacks. Third-party information security risks are managed by Deutsche Bank \nthrough a combination of capabilities, implementing a comprehensive approach to mitigate these risks and cover \nregulatory requirements (incl. the EU DORA regulation). Key components include the bank’s global third-party risk \nmanagement program, which is designed to identify, monitor, and mitigate risks associated with third-party engagements. \nIn combination, the bank demands adherence to an information security policy with specific control objectives for third \nparties, which include security incident notification requirements. To ensure adherence, the information security posture \nof the third parties is reevaluated on a periodic basis (defined by the criticality of the vendor). In response to specific threats \nand incidents, proactive engagement and outreach with these parties is taking place. This is complemented by security \nassessments, which also includes onsite assessments of third parties. These measures collectively contribute to the bank’s \noversight and support that third-party services align with the bank’s security requirements.

In 2024, Deutsche Bank’s Management Board approved the integration of a supplier-related \nkey performance indicator (KPI) into the annual performance evaluation and compensation packages for senior executives, \nincluding the responsible Management Board member. This KPI measures the percentage of addressable spend with \nsuppliers who have an ESG score above 45 out of 100 based on EcoVadis points or an equivalent standard from other \nrating agencies. \nThe supplier ESG score target was established with a strategic imperative to drive long-term success. It aims to identify \nand mitigate risks associated with suppliers who have no or low ESG scores by implementing corrective measures to \nimprove their ratings. Furthermore, it fosters transparency and joint accountability on strategic sustainability goals by \nsetting measurable and achievable targets for both Deutsche Bank and its suppliers. \nThe ESG score target aims to drive improvements and embed sustainability performance of Deutsche Bank’s most strategic \nsuppliers, as identified through improvements in their performance rating. It focuses on suppliers prioritized and ranked \nbased on the highest addressable spend value with no ESG scores, using historical spend data and contracts expiring \nbetween the fourth quarter in 2023 and the end of the financial year 2024. \n \n \n"}

In particular, it pursues the following \nenvironmental objectives:  \n– Climate change mitigation: including activities stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere\n– Climate change adaptation: including solutions that either significantly reduce the risk of adverse impacts of the current\nclimate or provide for adaptation solutions that help avoid the risk of adverse impacts on people, nature or other assets \n– Sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources: including activities contributing to the development of\ngood status of waters, including surface waters and groundwater, or prevent their deterioration where they are already\nin a good condition \n– Transition to a circular economy: including activities aimed at more efficient use of natural resources, in particular\nsustainable bio-based materials and other raw materials, in production by increasing the durability and accountability\nof products\n– Pollution prevention and control: including activities reducing emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere, improving\nair quality, eliminating waste, etc.\n– Protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems: including activities achieving favorable conservation status\nof natural and semi-natural habitats and species or prevent their deterioration where their conservation status is already\nfavorable \nDeutsche Bank was among the first international banks to explicitly refer to the EU Taxonomy Regulation in its Group-level \nSustainable Finance Framework. In particular, the bank aligned the eligibility criteria of its Sustainable Finance Framework \non a best effort basis with the EU Taxonomy’s technical screening criteria for the classification of activities as \nenvironmentally sustainable and specifically those related to the climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. As \nthe overall understanding of environmental and social matters and the EU Taxonomy are evolving, these criteria may be \nmodified.  \nSimilarly to Do No Significant Harm and Minimum social safeguards checks of client performance against environmental \nand social objectives required by the EU Taxonomy, Deutsche Bank already conducts reviews of clients’ overall \nmanagement approach and performance toward environmental and social challenges common to the industries in which \nthe client operates (for more information on these reviews, see the “ESG due diligence” chapter within this Sustainability \nStatement).  \nTo support sustainable activities of its clients and to facilitate their sustainability transition, the bank also offers and \ncontinuously develops different dedicated products as well as client engagement processes all of which seek to embed \nthe Taxonomy-related considerations. At the same time, the bank intends to build up internal expertise and capabilities, \ne.g., by training the relevant business units on sustainable finance.\nIn accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation and the related Disclosures Delegated Acts, for year-end \n2024, financial undertakings have to determine and disclose the proportion of exposures eligible to the EU Taxonomy in \ntheir covered assets (i.e., total assets less exposures toward central governments, central banks, supranational issuers and \nthe trading portfolio) for the six environmental objectives. Exposures aligned to the EU Taxonomy need to be reported for \nthe climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives for year-end 2024 and for the four remaining environmental \nobjectives starting from year-end 2025. \nWhere the use of proceeds is known at a transaction level, the bank considers relevant exposures to the extent the \nunderlying transaction is financing a Taxonomy eligible or aligned activity. For general purpose lending to counterparties \nsubject to the EU Taxonomy disclosure obligations as of year-end 2023, the bank considers exposures weighted by the \neligibility and alignment turnover and capital expenditure (capex) key performance indicators (KPIs) disclosed by its clients. \nThe turnover and capex KPIs are collected via a vendor, MSCI and mapped to relevant counterparties. Identification of \nundertakings with obligation to report under the EU Taxonomy and the related Disclosures Delegated Acts and their \nrespective Taxonomy KPIs is performed in a data collection project based on the materiality of the in-scope exposures, \nexcept for the assets under management disclosures which are based on external vendor classification.

Given the \nlow level of energy performance certificate (EPC) coverage in the portfolio, Taxonomy alignment of the residential real \nestate loans has been additionally determined via KfW sponsoring programs and the respective KfW Efficiency House \nstandards under which loans have been granted. Deutsche Bank has involved an external industry expert to determine \nwhich standards are compliant with the technical screening criteria for substantial contribution, as defined in the EU \nTaxonomy’s climate change mitigation activities 7.1 “Construction of new buildings” and 7.7 “Acquisition and ownership \nof buildings”. Based on that, buildings constructed until 31. December 2020 shall either have an EPC class A or belong to \n“the top 15% of the national or regional building stock expressed as operational Primary Energy Demand (PED)”. It was \nconcluded that buildings adhering to the criteria of KfW-70 or better are compliant with the “top 15% benchmark”. For \nbuildings constructed after 31. December 2020, the EU Taxonomy defines that the PED has to be “at least 10% lower than \nthe threshold set for the nearly zero-energy building (NZEB) requirements in national measures”. Here, it was concluded \nthat buildings adhering to the criteria of KfW-40 or better are compliant with the “at least 10% lower than NZEB”-\nbenchmark that is based on the updated German Buildings Energy Act (GEG/ Gebäudeenergiegesetz). Furthermore, EPCs \nare already widely collected in new business and their availability for the residential property stock is to be systematically \nincreased with proportionate measures.  \nFor Do No Significant Harm compliance under activity 7.7, the EU Taxonomy requires a robust climate-risk and vulnerability \nassessment in accordance with the criteria set out in Annex A of the Climate Delegated Act. Deutsche Bank has \noperationalized this assessment based on externally sourced data, leveraging the methodology from EBA Pillar 3 reporting. \nBuildings with a very high risk exposure to at least one physical climate risk are considered to be not aligned with the EU \nTaxonomy criteria, as the implementation of adaptation measures cannot be verified at present. \nDeutsche Bank recognizes the assessment of minimum social safeguards as defined under Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy \nRegulation, but also acknowledges the EU Commission’s guidance in the third Commission Notice published in November \n2024, which confirms under question 37 that retail clients shall not be assessed against minimum social safeguard \nrequirements, whilst raising that banks should instead assess the “the respective […] undertakings producing goods and \nproviding services that are purchased by retail clients” and citing “purchase of electric cars or solar panels” as examples \nfor moveable assets covered under this requirement. Accordingly, for residential real estate, constituting immovable \nassets, minimum social safeguards are currently not assessed. Deutsche Bank will monitor further implementation \nguidance in this regard and assess its application for the bank once clarification becomes available. \nFor consumer lending, the use of the proceeds information is currently not collected from customers. Accordingly, the \ninformation about Taxonomy alignment of the bank’s motor vehicle loan portfolio is currently not available. Taxonomy \nalignment of the renovation loan portfolio currently cannot be established either. \nThe calculation of Deutsche Bank’s Taxonomy KPIs is based on the prudential consolidation circle and FINREP balance \nsheet. \nThe table “Summary of KPIs to be disclosed by credit institutions under Article 8 Taxonomy Regulation” summarizes \nDeutsche Bank’s KPIs as of year-end 2024 which are detailed out in the section “Tabular disclosures in accordance with \nArticle 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation”: \n– Green asset ratio (GAR) stock was 1.0% based on the turnover KPIs and 1.2% based on the capex KPIs; the decrease of \nratios compared to the prior year was driven by stricter EU Taxonomy assessment criteria implemented for residential \nreal estate in 2024 \n– GAR flow KPIs stood at 0.2% and 0.4% respectively; GAR flow KPIs as well as coverage percentages were calculated \nbased on the total flow of loans and advances, debt securities and equity instruments to financial and non-financial \nundertakings and households in relation to total GAR assets flow; the calculation methodology for flow KPIs was refined \nfor year-end 2024; prior-year's comparatives were aligned to presentation in the current year \n– Financial guarantees stock KPIs were at 2.4% based on the turnover KPIs and 3.2% based on the capex KPIs \n– Assets under management stock KPIs stood at 1.4% and 2.2% respectively \n– KPIs for trading book and fees and commissions income are not required to be disclosed until year-end 2025 \nNumbers presented in the following tables may not add up due to rounding.

Additionally, the bank is focused on managing \nclimate-related risks and impacts linked to its financing and investment activities. To support these objectives, \nDeutsche Bank’s ambition level includes clear, quantifiable targets — both for decarbonizing portfolios in high-carbon \nemission industries and for growing sustainable business. \nTransition Plan \nESRS E1-1 \nSince Deutsche Bank’s Management Board made sustainability a strategic priority in 2019, the bank has made significant \nprogress toward achieving its interim targets for 2030. \nIn October 2023, Deutsche Bank published its Initial Transition Plan, which outlines the progress made and the strategy to \nreach its net-zero commitment. This plan consolidates the bank’s definitions, methodologies, targets and achievements \non its path. The progress is detailed in the respective chapters of this Sustainability Statement, including the “Sustainability \nStrategy” and “Client portfolios” chapters. \nThe plan adopts a holistic approach to the bank’s net-zero transition to support the Paris Agreement climate targets by \nfocusing on three dimensions of decarbonization: the bank’s own operations (Scope 1 and 2, including DWS); Deutsche \nBank’s supply chain (Scope 3, Categories 1 to 14, including DWS business travel emissions); and financing provided to \nclients (Scope 3, Category 15).

The associated targets to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions include: \n– Compensating for emissions from own operations (Scope 1 and 2) and business travel \n– Reducing total energy consumption by 30% by 2025 versus 2019 \n– Sourcing 100% renewable electricity by 2025 \n– Reducing fuel consumption of Deutsche Bank’s car fleet by 30% by 2025 and reaching carbon zero in Germany by 2030 \nThe bank implemented a decarbonization framework to reduce emissions resulting from its supply chain (Scope 3, \nCategories 1 to 14). This framework follows three levers: (1) reducing resource use, (2) substituting current resources with \nlower-carbon alternatives and (3) offsetting residual emissions where reduction is not feasible. \nIn 2024, the bank’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as Scope 3, Categories 1 to 14 emissions did not meet the double \nmateriality threshold and are therefore not included in the disclosures of this Sustainability Statement. Instead, \nDeutsche Bank provides detailed information on its approach in the Initial Transition Plan. \nDeutsche Bank created structures, processes and capabilities to enable the execution of the Transition Plan in key areas \nsuch as governance, Sustainable Finance Framework, data and technologies, as well as external engagement and \ncontinues to further develop them. Next to the Chief Sustainability Office, an additional enabler are ESG expert teams in \nthe bank’s business divisions and infrastructure functions that foster the implementation of Deutsche Bank’s sustainability \nstrategy and allow for a swift response to emerging business opportunities and potential risks.  \nIn the years ahead, Deutsche Bank aims to broaden the scope of decarbonization, i.e., progressing from financed emissions \nto financed and facilitated emissions and capturing opportunities in the bank’s private clients’ assets under management. \nMoreover, Deutsche Bank focuses on incorporating nature and biodiversity as well as just transition, which means to \naddress the challenges of transitioning for developing economies.  \nTo operationalize its commitments, the bank is further developing the Initial Transition Plan as tools, methodologies and \ndata for assessing the climate impact of its own operations, supply chain and clients’ activities continue to evolve. \nTherefore, Deutsche Bank includes forward-looking information and gives an outlook on how the bank will further broaden \nthe scope of its transition plan, specifically concerning financed emissions.  \nThe initial Transition Plan was published in October 2023. The next iteration will focus on full alignment with ESRS \nrequirements. During the annual planning process, Deutsche Bank continues to consider the latest net-zero scenarios and \neconomy-wide pathways to identify investment needs and their influence on the bank’s sustainable financing and \ninvestment plan. \nThe Initial Transition Plan publication, along with the net-zero pathways and decarbonization targets were approved by \nthe Group Sustainability Committee.

Impacts, risks and opportunities of the segment, together with their policies, are described in the \nchapter “Client portfolios in Asset Management” within this Sustainability Statement. \nIn compliance with requirement ESRS E1-1, Deutsche Bank hereby discloses that it is not excluded from EU Paris-aligned \nBenchmarks. \nGovernance \nESRS 2 GOV-3 \nDeutsche Bank’s governance of climate and environmental risks varies by activity. The governance of the activities that \ndrive the bank’s transformation, including those needed to fulfill Deutsche Bank’s pledge to achieve net-zero by 2050, is \nled by dedicated steering committees, while business-as-usual activities are incorporated into the bank’s existing risk \nmanagement governance structure as shown in the diagram below. \nThe Group Risk Committee, chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and established by the Management Board, has the mandate \nto oversee risk- and capital-related matters. This includes overall responsibility for the bank’s Climate and Environmental \nRisk Management Framework. The Committee approves the bank’s Climate and Environmental Risk Appetite, including \nthe appetite for deviation from the net-zero decarbonization pathways. Three other committees are responsible for the \ndevelopment and management of specific elements of climate and environmental risks: \n– The Enterprise Risk Committee, which is composed of senior risk experts from various risk disciplines, focuses on \nenterprise-wide risks trends and events. The committee oversees the development of the bank’s holistic Climate and \nEnvironmental Risk Management Framework \n– The Non-Financial Risk Committee which oversees, governs, and coordinates the management of non-financial risks \ngroup-wide and establishes a cross-risk and holistic perspective of the bank’s key non-financial risks, including risks to \nthe bank’s own infrastructure and employees arising from climate and environmental risks \n"}

Members of the forum are senior \nrepresentatives from the Business, Risk, and the Chief Sustainability Office. Following the establishment of Divisional \ncarbon budgets and risk appetite, the Investment Bank and the Commercial Bank each maintain their own Net Zero Forum. \nClimate and environmental topics are also regularly discussed in business unit risk councils and other committees and fora.  \nFor the “Change-the-Bank” governance, please refer to the “Sustainability Governance” section within the “Governance” \nchapter of this Sustainability Statement. \nThe Management Board receives monthly updates on financed emissions and net-zero alignment via the “Risk and Capital \nProfile” report. Each of Deutsche Bank’s core businesses integrates climate and environmental risks into planning and risk \nappetite statements as part of the bank’s annual strategic planning process, approved by the Management Board. \nCompliance is part of the overall Governance around climate and environmental risks and recognizes ESG risks as cross-\nrisk drivers integrated across Compliance Risk Types. These ESG drivers and Risk Types are an integral part of the annual \nCompliance Risk Assessment. In 2024, Compliance undertook a review of the management of greenwashing risk and its \nmanifestations within the scope of selected key Compliance Risk Types and related minimum control standards. On this \nbasis, Compliance further refined the ESG-related Risk Driver population for the relevant Risk Types. Compliance works \nwith key stakeholders across the Three-Lines-of-Defense as part of the ongoing initiatives to enhance the bank’s ability to \nidentify and manage ESG risk in its various manifestations. \nDeutsche Bank’s Internal Audit function (Group Audit) and Third Line-of-Defense provides independent and objective \nassurance to the Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG on the adequacy of the design, operating effectiveness, and \nefficiency of all the bank’s risk management processes including climate and environmental risks. Group Audit reviews \nfraud, antitrust and misconduct risks as part of each audit and reviews the respective policies and standards on a risk-\nbased approach. Group Audit also acts as an independent, proactive and forward-looking challenger and adviser to Senior \nManagement of the Group. \nStrategy \nDeutsche Bank’s management of climate and environmental risks and opportunities is part of its broader sustainability \nstrategy and supports the commitment to align the bank’s portfolio with net-zero by 2050. Other components of the bank’s \nsustainability strategy, together with the bank’s positive impacts and opportunities, including growth in sustainable \nfinancing, sustainable investment volumes, and the broader Environmental and Social Policy Framework, are described in \nthe “Sustainable finance” and “ESG due diligence” chapters of this Sustainability Statement. \nTransition plan for climate change mitigation \nDeutsche Bank’s initial transition plan for climate change mitigation is described in detail in the “Transition Plan” sub-\nchapter as part of the “Climate Change” chapter of this Sustainability Statement. \nMaterial impacts, risks and their interaction with strategy and business model \nIn 2024, Deutsche Bank identified material potential negative impacts related to both climate-change mitigation and \nadaptation through its double materiality assessment process described in the “Double materiality assessment” chapter \nof this Sustainability Statement. These negative impacts from the financing activities of the bank and its portfolio of clients \n(downstream value chain), should they materialize, would likely only manifest themselves in the longer-term (more than \n5 years).  \nFor climate change mitigation, potential material negative impacts to the environment and society were identified in \nrelation to: \n– Financing or investing in clients or assets in high carbon-emitting industries without credible transition plans, which \ncould in turn lead to increases in GHG emissions \n– Restricting lending to clients in high carbon-emitting industries which, as a consequence, could reduce the availability \nof financial resources needed by these companies for the implementation of their transition strategies  \nFor climate change adaptation, potential negative impacts to the environment and society were all scored below the \nmateriality threshold set by the bank. \n"}

Across the higher transition scenarios, \na broader range of clients are impacted and the potential deterioration in portfolio credit quality becomes more \npronounced. Revenue attrition (strategic risk) and potential reputational impacts are also higher. Physical risks drive losses \nin the low transition risk scenarios, materially impacting operational, credit, strategic and reputational risks. The disorderly \ntransition scenario yields the highest losses across all scenarios as clients face punitive carbon taxes and related policies \nwith limited time to adapt. \nScenario analysis is applied to the bank’s portfolios under the conservative assumption of a static balance sheet, without \naccounting for changes in capital allocation. Deutsche Bank would have significant flexibility to manage down higher risk \nexposures over time, especially in the long term. Conversely, the available scenarios carry a significant level of uncertainty, \nin particular in the long term, and do not consider potential risks arising from non-linearities, compounding effects and \ntipping points, which may lead to more severe outcomes.  \nThe results of the analysis are considered in the risk management frameworks, including the risk inventory and ICAAP. To \nensure that the bank remains resilient to these shocks and adequately capitalized, Deutsche Bank has put in place an \nexpert-driven add-on to its economic capital. This add-on is designed to capture uncertainty related to tail losses that \ncould arise in certain sectors from unexpected and abrupt changes in carbon prices. \nThe orderly and progressive execution of the bank’s sustainability strategy, including net-zero targets, growth in \nsustainable and transition financing, greater integration of nature into the bank’s risk frameworks, as well as client, product, \nand regional strategies, is key to mitigate credit and reputational risk impacts over the long term. \nMore information on the scenario analysis, its scope, time horizon, and the scenarios used is reported in the “Impact, risk \nand opportunity management – Process to identify and assess material climate-related risks: the scenarios” sub-chapter. \nImpact, risk and opportunity management \nProcess to identify and assess climate-related risks: materiality assessment  \nESRS 2 IRO-1  \nThe processes focused on the identification of positive impacts and opportunities in relation to climate change mitigation \nand adaptation are described in the “Sustainable finance” chapter of this Sustainability Statement.  \nNegative impacts are identified and assessed through the Double Materiality Assessment process, described in detail in \nthe “Double materiality assessment” chapter within this Sustainability Statement.

The output of the materiality assessment feeds into \nrisk management processes such as the risk inventory and is used to inform the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment \nProcess (ICAAP) and therefore supports the critical climate-related assumptions made in the bank’s financial statements.  \nThe Bank assesses these risks via scenario analysis applied to each of the bank’s main risk types, across all material \nportfolios, economic sectors, geographies, and across the short-, medium- and long-term horizons. For the purpose of its \nclimate and environmental materiality assessment, Deutsche Bank has defined its time horizons in the following way: \n– Short-term: 1 to 2 years \n– Medium-term: 3 to 5 years (i.e., from the first day of the 3rd year) \n– Long-term: More than 5 years \nThe scope of the materiality assessment and resilience analysis for climate and environmental risks covers almost the \nentirety of the bank’s portfolios, and includes Corporates, Sovereigns, Commercial and Residential Real Estate, Wealth \nManagement, and Consumer Finance (with nature scenarios only applied to portfolios identified as high risk for nature). \nWith respect to climate risk, the drivers considered were transition risks (e.g. arising from policy, technology, and behavioral \nchanges), and physical risks arising from acute (i.e. extreme weather events) and chronic (i.e. gradual changes in the \nclimate/environment) drivers. With respect to nature risk (other environmental risks), the bank considered drivers of nature \nloss arising from (i) terrestrial biodiversity and habitat loss, (ii) water depletion, (iii) ecosystem degradation from waste and \npollution and (iv) marine ecosystem degradation (from marine ecosystem use). \nThe analysis of how these factors drive each relevant risk type - namely credit, strategic and reputational, market, liquidity, \nand operational risks - was tailored to their specificities, as described in the following paragraphs. \nCredit risk shocks are modelled as credit rating migrations leading to shifts in the probability of default of clients affected, \nwhich in turn increase their expected credit losses. For instance, extreme weather-related events can affect a borrower’s \nown operations and value chain, and can result in loss of revenue, increased capital needs, insurance costs, and liabilities. \nFor transition risks, increases in credit losses are expected for carbon-intensive corporates under scenarios of \ndecarbonization of the economy where their product is of decreasing relevance and they have failed to adapt their business \nmodel. \nThe strategic and reputational risk assessment captures the impact on revenues and costs arising from climate and \nenvironmental risks. The analysis on strategic risks relates to the exposure identified as vulnerable in the climate transition, \nclimate physical and nature risk scenarios. The main sources of strategic risks identified for the bank are three-fold: \n– Loss of revenues from phasing out high-emitting clients (unwilling/unable to transition); \n– The bank failing take advantage of changing client behavior, leading to a loss of market share (e.g., failure to replace \nrevenues with transition-friendly clients); and \n– The bank’s client viability is negatively impacted, leading to reduced business and foregone revenues  \nTransition-related market risks are driven by new policies and regulations, new technologies, and shifting \ncustomers/investors sentiments and preferences; they transmit to banks through valuation losses on exposures to clients \nand assets impacted (Market Value losses under stress). \nLastly, the key metric for the estimate of liquidity risk effects is the loss of funding from withdrawals of deposits and \ndrawings against committed lending facilities (estimated on the basis of scenarios) of companies affected by the scenario \nshocks, such as companies involved in the extraction/processing of fossil fuels and companies with carbon intensive \nbusiness models. \n \n \n"}

The selection of portfolios in scope is informed by the results \nof the materiality assessment. \nThe stress test for credit risk includes transition and physical risks shocks across Large Corporates, Leveraged and \nStructured Finance, Residential and Commercial Real Estate over the short, medium- and long-term horizons. \nThe stress testing approach for credit risk in the corporate portfolio uses: \n– For Transition risk: a logistic regression model incorporating stressed financial ratios at individual client level, based on \nenvironmental-related and macroeconomic variables.

The scenarios simulate the impact of climate-physical and climate-transition risks drivers, in the \nshort-, medium- and long-term, and span from orderly/net-zero (underpinning the decarbonization strategy of the bank), \nto disorderly transition, and hot house scenarios. The bank also uses bespoke scenarios, developed in-house, to stress its \nportfolios against the drivers of nature-related risks. This breadth of scenarios gives the bank confidence that plausible \nrisks and uncertainties arising from climate change are covered.  \nAs mentioned earlier, all the scenarios conservatively assume a constant balance sheet throughout their time horizon, with \nno considerations for rebalancing or mitigating measures would very likely be implemented by the bank in the future. \nFor climate-physical risks, the bank follows Standard & Poor’s modelling framework. The S&P model uses information on \nthe: (i) type of each asset, (ii) its geographical location, (iii) the location’s corresponding exposure to an array of eight \ndiscrete climate change hazards and (iv) the asset’s ‘Impact Function’ (the relationship between the degree of change in \nclimate hazard exposure and change in financial impact for a given type of asset) across four future climate change \nscenarios based on the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP). \nThe methodology covers eight acute and chronic natural hazard types: fluvial flood, coastal flood, wildfires, drought, \nextreme heat, tropical cyclone, water stress, extreme cold. Deutsche Bank uses four RCP scenarios: \n– High climate change: Low mitigation scenario where total greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions triple by 2075 and global \naverage temperatures rise by 3.3 to 5.7°C by 2100 (acute physical risk) \n– Medium-High climate change: Limited mitigation scenario where total GHG emissions double by 2100 and global \naverage temperatures rise by 2.8 to 4.6°C by 2100 \n– Medium climate change: Strong mitigation scenario where total GHG emissions stabilize at current levels until 2050 \nand then decline and global average temperatures rise by 1.3 to 2.4°C by 2100 \n– Low climate change: Aggressive mitigation scenario where total GHG emissions reduce to net-zero by 2050 \nThe assessment of climate-transition risks is based on four scenarios:  \n– The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) reflects current policy settings of the energy-related policies that are in place and \nthose under development (lower transition). CO₂ emissions fall only moderately and therefore global warming continues \nto worsen, with the temperature rise heading towards 2.4°C in 2100 (IEA, 2023) causing high physical risks \n– The Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) assumes that all climate commitments made by governments (including \nNationally Determined Contributions) and industries around the world will be met (moderate transition). If successfully \nfulfilled, this would be consistent with a temperature rise of 2.1°C in 2100 (IEA, 2021) causing moderately high physical \nrisks  \n– The Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario (NZE) sets out a pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net-zero CO₂ \nemissions by 2050 and limits global warming to 1.5 °C (IEA, 2023) through stringent climate policies and innovation. In \nthis scenario, physical risks are relatively low but transition risks are high \n– The Disorderly scenario (delayed transition) assumes that annual emissions do not decrease until 2030 with drastic \npolicies needed thereafter to limit warming to below 2°C. This leads to high transition and physical risks than the NZE \nby 2050 scenario \nA standardized and comprehensive set of nature risk scenarios, such as the ones available for climate is not yet available \nto serve the needs of financial institutions. To fill this gap, Deutsche Bank developed 20 in-house exploratory transition \nand physical nature risk scenarios, covering each of the four nature risk types assessed by the bank, namely (i) Terrestrial \nbiodiversity and habitat loss, (ii) Water depletion, (iii) Ecosystem degradation from waste and pollution, and (iv) Marine \necosystem degradation). The scenario narratives were informed by the review of the conclusions of chapter 4 of the IPBES \nglobal assessment report, the work on nature risks scenarios of the World Bank, use cases developed by the Cambridge \nInstitute for Sustainability Leadership with global banks, the full list of Explorative Nature-Related risk Scenarios \ndeveloped jointly by the Bank of Negara Malaysia and the World Bank Group in 2022, among others. The nature risk \nscenarios were developed across the short-, medium- and long-term time horizons (i.e. each scenario is attributed a \nspecific time horizon). The definitions for short- medium- and long-term are provided in the previous sub-chapter.  \nFor more information on how the shocks for each climate and nature-risk scenario are applied to each risk type, please see \nthe “Impact, risk and opportunity management/Process to identify and assess climate-related risks: materiality \nassessment” sub-chapter of the “Climate change” chapter within this Sustainability Statement). \n \n \n"}

More information on the \nassessment underlying the nature-risk dashboard is included in the “Metrics and targets – Nature-related (or other-\nenvironmental) risks” sub-chapter of the “Climate change” chapter within this Sustainability Statement. \nClimate risks are considered as potential triggers for inclusion in the watchlist of groups or counterparties in carbon-\nintensive industries and without adequate transition risk mitigation strategy in place (and/or with limited financial \nresources to finance their transition). The criteria take into consideration internal credit ratings and the scores from the \ntransition risk scorecards. \nLastly, Deutsche Bank's Environmental and Social Policy Framework outlines specific restrictions, due diligence and \nescalation requirements for sectors with inherently elevated potential for negative environmental impacts. \nWith regards to the valuation of collateral, the bank’s Global Collateral Management Guide (for Banking Book Collateral) \nsets its environmental standards based on the requirements of the Capital Requirements Regulation for the initial \nvaluation, monitoring, and review over the life of the loan. Deutsche Bank’s underwriting standards require real estate \ncollateral to be appropriately insured against relevant risks including applicable natural hazards. In some countries, \nsupplemental insurance against natural hazards is provided by the government. The European residential real estate \nportfolio amounted to € 166.4 billion at year-end 2024. Residential mortgages for private clients in Germany represent \napproximately 92% of this amount and around 1.2 million German private residences financed by loans secured by \nimmovable properties are insured appropriately against relevant risks including applicable natural hazards. The insurance \ncover by real estate owners is monitored and complemented or substituted by Deutsche Bank´s own insurance. \nIn addition, new valuations and re-valuations require the identification of material environmental physical and transition \nrisks that could materialize. Any identified material risks must be reflected in the credit decision and/or valuation if not \nmitigated by construction measures and/or insurance cover. Comparable requirements are in place for other physical \ncollateral, including large movable assets (such as airplanes and ships) and smaller assets (such as cars and machines). \nInsurance coverage on loan collateral is monitored on a regular basis, including by means of onsite inspections. \nMarket risk framework \nAs part of the Market Risk identification process, individual business lines are asked to consider forward-looking and/or \nidiosyncratic material risks, including climate and other environmental risks, which must be included in the Market Risk \nidentification documentation. Additionally, as part of the new product and transaction approval control standards of the \nMarket & Valuation Risk Management function, climate and environmental drivers are required to be assessed and recorded \nas part of the approval process.  \nClimate-related risks are managed within the existing market risk framework and treated as a price trigger, in the same way \nas market events such as central bank announcements or earnings announcements. Market risk monitors and reports \ninternally “highly carbon intensive” exposures (as per Deutsche Bank’s climate risk taxonomy) and financed emissions in its \ntraded credit portfolio. The report provides granular views required for the management of exposures, and the top \nexposures are reported to the Enterprise Risk Committee on a quarterly basis. \nFurthermore, a weekly climate stress scenario to assess transition and physical risks in the trading book portfolio is \nembedded into the bank’s market risk appetite framework. \nLiquidity risk framework \nDeutsche Bank uses stress testing and pathway analysis to assess the impact of climate risk on liquidity. In particular, the \nbank’s stressed net liquidity position scenarios, which are run daily, include climate disasters as possible triggers of stress \n(physical risks). \nThe analysis shows that physical risks are generally smaller than other risks for which the bank daily reserves liquidity. \nTransition risk, which is expected to develop incrementally over many years, will be managed through the Group’s annual \nfunding planning processes.

Several initiatives \nhave been conducted by Deutsche Bank to improve its control environment and raise internal awareness on greenwashing, \nincluding: \n– Conducting a deep dive risk review in relation to the existing control environment around greenwashing; \n– Applying scenario analysis as a standard risk management tool to investigate potential sources of ESG-related litigation \nrisks, understand the main drivers and causes of such scenarios (e.g., the misrepresentation of sustainability information \nin corporate communication or public disclosures) as well as which controls or remediation activities can mitigate such \nscenarios and what steps are to be taken to improve the control environment; \n– Continuous monitoring of external cases of greenwashing; and \n– Introducing mandatory greenwashing training for all Deutsche Bank employees \nThe management of reputational risk arising from climate and environmental risks is covered in the “ESG due diligence” \nchapter within this Sustainability Statement.  \nRisk appetite framework \nThe development of risk appetite, escalation processes and governance was of particular importance in the \nimplementation of the climate and environmental risk management framework, and in particular: \n– The establishment of risk appetite thresholds around the Net-Zero decarbonization targets, monitored via a dedicated \nreport, with breaches escalated to the Group Risk Committee and the Group Sustainability Committee \n– The review of new transactions or limit extensions with a significant impact on the bank’s financed emissions or Net \nZero targets by a dedicated Net Zero Forum, consisting of senior representatives from the Business, Risk, and the Chief \nSustainability Office. The review of the forum’s members includes an assessment of the client’s sustainability \ndisclosures, transition strategies, decarbonization targets and governance. New transactions must fit within Deutsche \nBank’s internal sectoral risk appetite aligned to net-zero targets. In 2024, the Group-level sectoral risk appetite metrics \nwere cascaded to the business divisions, to enhance their responsibility and support their business strategies. \n– The sectoral restriction of the Environmental and Social Policy Framework, which are monitored and enforced through \nthe Environmental and Social due diligence and the escalation requirements of the Reputational Risk Framework of the \nbank; and \n– The establishment of Early Warning Indicators for concentrations of climate-transition, climate-physical and nature-\nrelated risks \nMore information on the bank’s metrics and targets, including achieved and expected emission reductions associated to \nthe targets, is provided in the “Metrics and targets” sub-chapter of the “Climate change” chapter. The Environmental and \nSocial Policy Framework is described in detail in the “ESG due diligence” chapter within this Sustainability Statement.  \nTrainings \nTraining and risk awareness sessions on climate and environmental risk were held throughout the year. The sessions were \ndelivered to risk management staff, businesses, and senior leadership teams in various jurisdictions, on topics such \nsustainable finance, physical risk assessment, nature risks, and the Non-Financial Risk ESG policy. Furthermore, an ESG \nsection has been added to the mandatory Risk Awareness module in 2024. \n \n \n"}

Change vs. baseline is N/A for Commercial Aviation \nas this is the first year of publication \nAchieved and expected emissions reductions are disclosed in the relevant columns of the above target table. For Oil and \nGas (Upstream) and Coal Mining sectors, these reductions are expressed in absolute terms (i.e. Scope 3 End Use financed \nemissions). For the remaining sectors, they reflect a change in the physical intensity metric or climate alignment scores \n(which are expressed in percentages). \nThe conversion of the relative or physical intensity metrics sectoral targets into absolute reductions of GHG emissions (ex. \nESRS Requirement E1-4 34a/b) is not disclosed as the Transitional Provisions of ESRS1 par. 133b allows the bank to focus \non the more established physical intensity metrics required by the Pillar 3 legislation. \nSince the inception of net-zero targets, the bank is making considerable decarbonization progress across sectors which \nhas been supported by active management of the business outlined in the above-mentioned Governance section. The \nCement sector has been an exception, however, due to the lack of readily available technological alternatives (i.e. a hard-\nto-abate sector) as well as the reduced potential for active management given the bank’s small loan commitment size. \nOil and Gas (Upstream): Scope 3 financed emissions stood at 19.2 MtCO2/y as of year-end 2024, 4% higher year-on-year \nbut 18% below the 2021 baseline and below the NZ target pathway when linearly interpolating between 2021 and 2030. \nThe temporary effects seen in the first year (year-end 2022) which led to a sharp decline in financed emissions are now \nbeing partially reversed as expected. Since target inception, the overall financed emissions reduced in line with the linear \nreduction pathway implied by the 2030 net zero target. Total loan commitments marginally increased year-on-year from \n€ 9.4 billion to € 9.6 billion. The year-on-year increase in financed emissions can be explained by three factors: (i) client \nemission factors (tCO2/€ m) which led to an increase of 1.9 MtCO2/y; (ii) active management of the portfolio which led to \na decrease of 0.8 MtCO2/y; and (iii) loan exposure FX translation effects from 2022 to 2023 predominantly driven by U.S. \ndollar depreciating versus the euro which led to financed emissions decreasing by 0.4 MtCO2/y. The bank expects Oil and \nGas financed emissions to remain volatile due to factors outside of its control such as the evolution of clients’ EVIC or total \nassets which are key inputs into the calculation. \nPower Generation: The Scope 1 physical emission intensity of Deutsche Bank’s Power Generation portfolio was \n312 kgCO2e/MWh as of year-end 2024, 16% lower year-on-year predominantly driven by the movement of a single large \nclient position. The reduction in physical emission intensity came with total loan commitments decreasing year-on-year \nfrom € 13.3 billion to € 11.8 billion. \nAutomotive (Light Duty): The Scope 3 physical emission intensity of Deutsche Bank’s Automotive portfolio was \n162 gCO2/vkm as of year-end 2024, 1.8% higher year-on-year but 15% below the 2021 baseline. The portfolio tailpipe \nemission intensity metric has marginally worsened due to a few material clients whose tailpipe emission intensities \nincreased year-on-year caused by a relative decrease in their production of vehicles with lower emission internal \ncombustion engines (ICE). All of the impacted clients have transition strategies in place. Total loan commitments have \nremained constant year-on-year. \nSteel: The Scope 1 and 2 physical emission intensity of Deutsche Bank’s Steel portfolio was 1,234 kgCO2e/t steel as of \nyear-end 2024, falling 10.8% year-on-year despite a marginal increase of loan commitments from € 2.0 billion to \n€ 2.2 billion. The reduction in physical emission intensity has been predominantly driven by re-balancing towards lower \nintensity clients. \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 304, "text": " \n272 \nDeutsche Bank  \nEnvironmental information \nAnnual Report 2024 \nClimate change \nCoal Mining: Scope 3 financed emissions stood at 4.6 MtCO2/y as of year-end 2024 of which 2.4 and 2.2 MtCO2/y came \nfrom thermal and metallurgical coal sources respectively and represents a 25% year-on-year decrease. Total loan \ncommitments of in-scope clients marginally decreased from € 1.4 billion to € 1.2 billion. While on a coal revenue share \nbasis, total loan commitments marginally increased to € 0.3 billion. The year-on-year decrease in financed emissions can \nbe explained by three factors: (i) client emission factors (tCO2/€ m) which led to financed emissions reduction of \n2.2 MtCO2/y, (ii) client portfolio effects which led to an increase of 0.9 MtCO2/y; and (iii) loan exposure FX translation \neffects from 2022 to 2023 predominantly driven by U.S. dollar depreciating versus the euro which led to financed \nemissions decreasing by 0.2 MtCO2/y. The bank expects Coal Mining financed emissions to remain highly volatile due to \nthe metric’s sensitivity to factors such as the evolution of clients’ EVIC or total assets, coal mining production data sourced \nfrom the bank’s data provider, coal mining revenue share (i.e. 5% threshold applied), and/or yearly FX translation effects. \nCement: The Scope 1 and 2 physical emission intensity of Deutsche Bank’s Cement portfolio was 781 kgCO2e/t as of year-\nend 2024, rising 2.4% year-on-year and 6.9% above the 2022 baseline. The increasing trend of portfolio-level physical \nemission intensities since the baseline year can be explained by two factors: (i) the cement sector is a hard-to-abate sector; \nand (ii) the bank’s smaller portfolio size with € 0.3 billion loan commitments as of year-end 2024 which results in less \npotential for active portfolio management, as well as higher inherent metric volatility. \nShipping: As of year-end 2023, Deutsche Bank’s PP portfolio climate alignment scores were 19.7% and 14.2% for the \nStriving and Minimum scenarios respectively and had marginally worsened by 1.4 pp and 0.1 pp year-on-year for the \nStriving and Minimum scenarios respectively. A modelled-versus-verified Annual Efficiency Ratio (AER) ratio of 25:75 on a \nloan-weighted basis was achieved and an improvement in terms of the use of verified AER shipping emission intensity data \ncompared to last year’s ratio of 30:70. \nAviation: This is the first year disclosing a portfolio climate alignment score following the Pegasus Guidelines which was \n1.3% as of year-end 2023. The metric covers Scope 1 emissions from revenue generating passenger services and belly \nfreight, as well as dedicated cargo freight operations of commercial airliners. The current focus is on operators of aircrafts \ngiven they have the greater influence on operational load factors as well as adoption of new technologies, both of which \nwill accordingly drive the industry’s CO2 emission levels. Lessors are currently excluded as the bank is assessing the \neffectiveness of a physical emission intensity type target on lessors given their role is limited to modern aircraft rollout and \nretrofitting existing aircrafts to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel. In line with the Pegasus Guidelines, Deutsche Bank’s year-\nend 2024 portfolio climate alignment score will be disclosed in next year’s Sustainability Statement, based on 2024 data. \nMethodology notes \nCorporate lending boundary: \n– Deutsche Bank focuses on corporate lending within: (i) loans at amortized cost and (ii) irrevocable and revocable lending \ncommitment as found in the Risk Report section of Deutsche Bank’s Annual Report. As of year-end 2024, loans at \namortized cost and irrevocable and revocable lending commitment were € 484.6 billion and € 269.7 billion respectively. \n– If corporate lending is reported under the bank’s underwriting policy as a position to be de-risked via the capital markets \nthen such corporate lending is excluded from the Net Zero Target Framework  \n– Corporate lending is identified according to Deutsche Bank’s internal sectoral classifications. The bank excludes all \nlending to financial institutions, public sector, real estate, and securitization \nEight sectors in scope of Deutsche Bank’s Net-Zero Target Framework: \n– The general approach of Deutsche Bank’s Net-Zero Target Framework is to follow industry practices such as the Paris \nAgreement Capital Transition Assessment (PACTA) methodology, the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials \n(PCAF) Standard, the Poseidon Principles, and the Pegasus Guidelines. While the following bullet points cover the main \nmethodological points, the reader can find more detailed information in the public domain on these open-source \nmethodologies \n– Client-level asset data is sourced from Asset Impact, Det Norske Veritas, and IBA. Enterprise Value including cash (EVIC) \nclient data is sourced from MSCI \n– The Oil and Gas (Upstream) sector follows a Scope 3 End Use financed emission approach which is expressed as \nMtCO₂/y and covers upstream activities only. Oil and gas production values are converted into emissions by using \ncombustion constants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Per the PCAF approach, the denominator \nof the Attribution Factor is EVIC or total assets. The bank expects the Oil and Gas Scope 3 End Use financed emissions \nto remain volatile due to factors outside of its control such as the evolution of clients’ EVIC or total assets which are key \ninputs into the financed emissions calculation. In order to reduce volatility, the latest (year-end 2024) loan exposure \ndata is converted to EUR-equivalent loan exposures using 2023 FX rates such that is consistent with the bank’s latest \nScope 3 emission factors. The decarbonization pathway is calibrated from the IEA NZE (2021) datasets \n \n \n"}

Clients’ installed power capacity (MW) data is converted \nto power generation (MWh) by using global capacity factors used in the IEA NZE (2021) scenario. This conversion from \ncapacity to generation accounts for the intermittent nature of renewables which have lower capacity factors compared \nto nuclear sources, for example. The decarbonization pathway is calibrated from the IEA NZE (2021) datasets \n– The Steel production sector follows the PACTA approach and the metric tracked is a loan-weighted average of clients’ \nScope 1 and 2 physical emission intensity expressed as kgCO₂e/tons of steel. The decarbonization pathway is calibrated \nfrom the IEA NZE (2021) datasets \n– The Automotive sector follows the PACTA approach and the metric tracked is a loan-weighted average of clients’ Scope \n3 (i.e., tailpipe/tank-to-wheel) physical emission intensity expressed as gCO₂/vehicle-kilometers. Deutsche Bank only \ncovers vehicle manufacturers and the Light Duty vehicle segment. The decarbonization pathway is calibrated from the \nIEA NZE (2021) datasets \n– The Coal Mining sector follows a Scope 3 End Use financed emission approach which is expressed as MtCO₂/y. Coal \nmining production values are converted into emissions by using combustion constants from the U.S. EPA. Per the PCAF \napproach, the denominator of the Attribution Factor is EVIC or total assets. In order to reduce volatility, the latest (year-\nend 2024) loan exposure data is converted to EUR-equivalent loan exposures using 2023 FX rates such that is consistent \nwith the bank’s latest Scope 3 emission factors. Eligible clients are considered in the following way: whether more than \n5% of their revenue is derived from (thermal and metallurgical) coal mining, and if so, whether it could be tracked \nalternatively via demand-led sectors such as Power Generation or Steel production. This is the preferred approach as it \nincentivizes the reduction of the demand for coal mining and thus aims to avoid supply constrictions that could lead to \nmarket imbalances. The bank expects Coal Mining metrics to remain volatile due to factors outside of its control such \nas the evolution of clients’ EVIC or total assets which are key inputs into the financed emissions calculation. The \ndecarbonization pathway is calibrated from the IEA NZE (2022) datasets and on the ratio of thermal versus metallurgical \nfinanced emissions as of the baseline reference year. Should this ratio significantly vary in the future, the pathway will \nbe re-calibrated such that it remains representative of the bank’s coal mining portfolio \n– The Cement production sector follows the PACTA approach and the metric tracked is a loan-weighted average of \nclients’ Scope 1 and 2 physical emission intensity expressed as kgCO₂e/tons of cement. Cementitious products (e.g. Fly \nAsh) are not included. The decarbonization pathway is calibrated from the IEA NZE (2022) dataset \n– The Shipping sector follows the Poseidon Principles methodology (Technical Guidance 5.1). The metric tracked is the \nclimate alignment score expressed as a percentage difference between a vessel’s Annual Efficiency Ratio (AER, e.g., \ngCO₂e/dwt-nm) versus its decarbonization pathway that is calibrated to said vessel’s type and size. The portfolio level \nmetric is the loan-weighted average of each vessel’s climate alignment score. The bank expects the Revised-Striving \nand Revised-Minimum portfolio climate alignment metrics to be volatile given AER is sensitive to vessel operational \nfactors. The decarbonization pathway is calibrated from the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Revised Strategy \nadopted at the Marine Environmental Protection Committee (MEPC 80) in July 2023 \n– The Aviation sector follows the Pegasus Guidelines methodology announced in April 2024. The metric tracked is the \nclimate alignment score expressed as a percentage difference between an airliner’s physical emission intensity \nexpressed as gCO₂e/revenue-ton-kilometers versus its decarbonization pathway of said airliner’s activity in terms of \npassenger plus belly freight versus dedicated cargo freight. Currently, only commercial airliners are in scope. The bank \nexpects the portfolio climate alignment metrics to be volatile given sensitivity to passenger, belly freight, and dedicated \ncargo freight load factors. The decarbonization pathway is from the Mission Possible Partnership “Prudent” (MPP PRU) \nRoadmap. The portfolio-level climate alignment score is the percentage differences between the clients’ loan-weighted \naverage of their gCO₂e/revenue-ton-kilometers versus said clients’ loan-weighted average of their points in their \ndecarbonization pathways weighted by their activities in terms of passenger plus belly freight versus dedicated cargo \nfreight \nClient-purchased offsets (certificates based on GHG reductions, permits, and/or avoidance schemes) are not taken into \naccount as Deutsche Bank’s net-zero target framework is based on metrics that are defined as a combination of: (i) the \ntechnical characteristics of the assets; and (ii) GHG conversion factors of physical activities. \nConsistent with the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) Guidelines for Climate Target Setting for Banks (Version 2), Deutsche \nBank pursues third-party independent limited assurance over the reporting against targets, including the establishment of \na baseline. \n \n \n"}

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 311, "text": " \n279 \nDeutsche Bank  \nEnvironmental information \nAnnual Report 2024 \nClimate change \n Corporate Lending Portfolio \nOn a loan outstanding basis, Scope 1 and 2 financed emissions increased year-on-year from 28.1 to 32.0 MtCO2e/y while \nScope 3 financed emissions decreased year-on-year from 137.5 to 135.1 MtCO2e/y. On a total corporate lending basis, \nScope 1 and 2 financed emissions increased year-on-year from 63.5 to 64.7 MtCO2e/y and Scope 3 financed emissions \nincreased year-on-year from 392.0 to 427.8 MtCO2e/y. Despite Scope 1, 2, and 3 financed emissions increasing year-on-\nyear, Scope 1, 2 versus 3 economic intensities have decreased by 8.3% and 1.9% respectively as total loan commitments \nhave increased 11% year-on-year of which roughly one-quarter can be explained by FX translation effects from 2023 to \n2024. \nThe inclusion of the bank’s client’s Scope 3 emissions for the first time has changed the top three sector rankings - \nManufacturing and Engineering, Automotives, and Oil and Gas - where for the first and second sectors, their high emissions \nare driven by their total expected lifetime emissions of their sold products. \nIn terms of year-on-year changes, the Utilities sector has been notable as its Scope 1 and 2 financed emissions decreased \nby 2.7 MtCO2e/y and its economic intensity decreased by 8.0% which was driven by the movement of a single large client. \nIn terms of Scope 3 financed emissions, the Manufacturing and Engineering sector increased by 33 MtCO2e/y year-on-year \nand its economic intensity increased by 22% year-on-year which was mainly driven by a single client with a high emission \nintensity due to the lifetime emissions of its products sold in the power generation sector. Products sold in this sector such \nas gas turbines are tracked via the bank’s Net-Zero Target Framework which covers power generation clients that operate \ngas power plants assets. \nOn a total loan commitment basis, the following factors can explain year-on-year changes in Scope 1, 2 and 3 financed \nemissions: \n– For Scope 1 and 2 financed emissions, due to the general rise of Enterprise Values (including Cash) (EVICs) from 2022 \nto 2023, client-specific emission factors decreased which led to a financed emissions reduction of 1.4 MtCO₂e/y. For \nScope 3 financed emissions, the same effect also led to a financed emissions reduction of 2.1 MtCO₂e/y \n– Data quality improved year-on-year which led to a financed emissions decrease of 0.1 MtCO₂e/y for Scope 1 and 2 and \nan increase of 8.7 MtCO₂e/y for Scope 3 financed emissions \n– Year-on-year FX translation effects of euro-equivalent loan exposures led to a financed emissions increase of 0.9 \nMtCO₂e/y and 9.2 MtCO₂e/y for Scope 1 and 2 versus Scope 3 financed emissions, respectively. This is due to the U.S. \ndollar strengthening against the euro between year-end 2023 and year-end 2024 \n– The remaining factor is client portfolio effects which contributed to increases of 1.9 MtCO₂e/y for Scope 1 and 2 \nfinanced emissions and 20.0 MtCO₂e/y for Scope 3 financed emissions \nResidential Real Estate Portfolio \nAs of year-end 2024, financed emissions for the European residential real estate portfolio amounted from 2.5 to 2.2 \nMtCO2e/y with an energy intensity reduction from 13.7 to 13.04 kgCO₂e/m²/y. The lower financed emissions in 2024 are \nmainly driven by the reduced volume size of the mortgage portfolio. The combination of regular repayment and lower \nloan-to-values reduce the bank’s part of financed emissions. \nMethodological notes \nFinanced emissions of the corporate loan portfolio: \n– This bank follows the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) Standard, Part A (2022), where more \ntechnical information can be found in the public domain given its open-source status. In particular, the financed \nemissions approach for the corporate loan portfolio follows Chapter 5.2 \n– Deutsche Bank focuses on corporate lending within: (i) loans at amortized cost and (ii) irrevocable and revocable lending \ncommitment as found in the Risk Report section of Deutsche Bank’s Annual Report. As of year-end 2024, loans at \namortized cost and irrevocable and revocable lending commitment were € 484.6 billion and € 269.7 billion respectively. \n– If corporate lending is judged to ultimately facilitate a primary issuance and is covered by a sector tracked by the net \nzero target framework, then such corporate lending is considered as part of the facilitated emissions methodology and \nhence excluded from financed emissions calculations \n– Corporate lending is identified according to Deutsche Bank’s internal sectoral classifications. The bank excludes all \nlending to financial institutions, public sector, real estate, and securitizations \n– Scope 1, 2, and 3 financed emissions are calculated on a total loan commitment basis so as to align with the approach \nused for the bank’s decarbonization targets \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 312, "text": " \n280 \nDeutsche Bank  \nEnvironmental information \nAnnual Report 2024 \nClimate change \n– The financed emissions figures rely on client-specific data as well as proxy emissions factors. Scope 1 and 2 client-\nspecific emissions data is sourced from MSCI and is always reported data from the client. Scope 3 client-specific \nemissions data is sourced from MSCI and can be either reported or estimated using MSCI’s proprietary logic. Scope 1 \nand 2 proxy emission factors are sourced from PCAF and use the 2019 Exiobase dataset (Exiobase v3.7, base year 2015) \nversion as recommended by PCAF given these proxies were used in the baseline reference year. Scope 3 proxy emission \nfactors are internally built sector-country averages based on client-specific emissions data (reported and estimated) \nfrom MSCI \n– Enterprise Value including cash (EVIC) is used as the denominator of the PCAF attribution factor and sourced from MSCI \n– Scope 3 financed emissions estimates are expected to remain volatile due to factors outside of the bank’s control such \nas: (i) the evolution of clients’ EVIC, as well as (ii) the inclusion of total expected lifetime emissions from products sold \nwhich are significantly higher in sectors related to manufacturing activities, for example \n– Differences in Scope 3 financed emissions estimates can arise for the Oil and Gas and Coal Mining sectors between the \nbank’s ‘Financed Emissions: Scope 3 Category 15’ versus the Net-Zero Target Framework. This can be explained by: (i) \ndifferent coverage of Scope 3 categories; or (ii) different coverage of sub-sectors; or (iii) differences in Scope 3 emission \nfactor estimates due to differing approaches in terms of methodology and/or dataset \n– There is no correction attempted for the possibility of emissions double-counting (or more) as a result of introducing \nclients’ Scope 3 emissions (alongside their Scope 1 and 2 emissions) in financed emissions calculation \n– PCAF Data Quality scores are calculated according to the rules outlined in the PCAF Standard and reflect the extent to \nwhich sectoral proxy estimates were utilized in the calculation of financed emissions. They are an indication of the \nchallenges that the bank and the industry still face with getting access to consistent and audited client-specific climate \nrisk data. Methodology and data changes may significantly impact the estimates over time \n– As of year-end 2024, the share of primary data used for the calculation of Scope 1 and 2 was 41%, and 17% for Scope 3 \nfinanced emissions, on a total loan commitment basis. Primary data is defined as data which is flagged as “reported” by \nMSCI that the bank uses to source emission data \n– Client-purchased offsets (certificates based on GHG reductions, permits, and/or avoidance schemes) are not taken into \naccount in financed emissions calculations \nFinanced Emissions of Residential Real Estate:  \n– Deutsche Bank identifies loans collateralized by residential real estate based on the Financial Reporting (FinRep) \ndefinition in accordance with the EZB-Regulation on reporting of regulatory financial information \n– Financed emissions and emissions intensity of Deutsche Bank’s European residential real estate portfolio are calculated \nby applying a model-based approach, incorporating Energy Performance Certificates (real and proxied), real estate \ncollateral data, decarbonization scenarios, DENA and PCAF data. Based on the PCAF methodology, Deutsche Bank \nrestricts the transition risk metrics to financed emissions and emissions intensity which are defined by the proportion of \nthe collateral linked to the outstanding loan amount \n– The Net Zero projections towards 2050 are performed by deploying the International Energy Agency (IEA) \ndecarbonization scenarios as well as country specific Carbon Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) pathways  \n– The PCAF Data Quality scores are calculated according to the instructions for mortgages as outlined in PCAF’s The \nGlobal GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard Part A: Financed Emissions (Second edition, December 2022) and \nincorporates the usage of EPC data (i.e., CO₂ values). The scores reflect the extent to which proxy estimates were utilized \ni.e., PCAF DQ score 2 is applied if the available EPC contains the respective CO₂ value, whereas estimation of CO₂ values \nbased on real EPC data result in a PCAF DQ score of 3. A PCAF DQ score 4 is linked to CO₂ values being estimated by \nthe above-mentioned model-based approach. PCAF DQ score 5 is assigned if none of the above apply. In the final stage, \nafter assigning the PCAF DQ score, the average score per counterparty domicile (Germany, Italy, and Spain) is \ncalculated, weighted by the outstanding gross carrying amount \n– The share of primary data used for the calculation of financed emissions is 5.5% on an outstanding gross carrying \namount basis. Primary data is defined as utilizing actual EPC data without proxy which reflects a PCAF Data Quality \nscore of 2 \nOther metrics used to monitor climate-transition risks \nThe bank uses additional global and sector-specific key performance indicators to monitor and steer climate risk across its \nportfolios. Examples of these indicators are Scope technology mixes, and the share of clients with reported net-zero \ntargets. \n \n \n"}

To estimate the overall exposure to physical climate risks, \nDeutsche Bank utilizes composite hazards scores and the medium-high risk scenario (a limited mitigation scenario in which \ntotal greenhouse gas emissions double by 2100 and global average temperatures rise between 2.8°C and 4.6°C by 2100). \nFor the purpose of public disclosures, Deutsche Bank considers the fluvial flood, coastal flood and tropical cyclones as \nacute risk and maps water stress, drought, wildfire, extreme heat and extreme cold as chronic risk. \nOnly a small proportion of the bank’s European residential real estate portfolio is deemed vulnerable to acute or chronic \nphysical risks as the physical risk factors for Europe are significantly lower than in other parts of the world. Furthermore, \nresidual risk remains low for the European residential real estate portfolio owing to the insurance coverage of private \nclients, additional all-risks insurance for Germany (Deutsche Bank as an issuer of covered bonds is obliged to have this \ninsurance in place), and national protection schemes in Italy and Spain. \nA summary of exposures to chronic and acute physical risks is provided in the table below.  \nLoan exposure to physical risks of the Residential Real Estate portfolio \nCountry \nDec 31, 2024 \nLoan exposure, Outstanding € bn \nTotal \nChronic \nAcute \nEU \n166.4 \n18.1 \n0.6 \nthereof: Germany \n153.2 \n14.7 \n0.3 \nthereof: Spain \n6.4 \n2.3 \n0.0 \nthereof: Italy \n4.2 \n1.2 \n0.2 \nthereof: Rest of EU \n2.6 \n0.0 \n0.0 \nNon-EU \n5.1 \n0.2 \n1.6 \n \n   \nCountry \nDec 31, 2023 \nLoan exposure, Outstanding € bn \nTotal \nChronic \nAcute \nEU \n172.6 \n4.4 \n1.3 \nthereof: Germany \n158.1 \n2.0 \n0.9 \nthereof: Spain \n6.3 \n1.0 \n0.0 \nthereof: Italy \n4.8 \n1.1 \n0.1 \nthereof: Rest of EU \n3.3 \n0.3 \n0.3 \nNon-EU \n4.5 \n2.1 \n1.8 \n \n   \nThe continuous enhancements to processes, refinement of methodology and forward-looking information can result in \nchanges to exposures subject to physical risks. \nNature-related (or other-environmental) risks  \nIndustry standards and methodologies in relation to nature risk identification, monitoring and target setting are at an early \nstage of development. While not considered material for the 2024 DMA assessment, recognizing the increasing \nimportance of these risks to the bank and its stakeholders (from regulators and supervisors to investors and clients), \nDeutsche Bank developed an in-house approach for the identification of exposures potentially vulnerable to nature-\nrelated risks.  \nDeutsche Bank’s analysis of nature-related risks focuses on four different types of nature loss: (i) terrestrial biodiversity \nand habitat loss; (ii) water depletion; (iii) marine ecosystem degradation; and (iv) ecosystem degradation from waste and \npollution. This classification allows the bank to capture in its assessment most of the pressures on nature from human \nactivities, as listed by the Science Based Targets Network (SBTN) and ecosystem services of the ENCORE tool. \nThe bank identifies exposure to each of the four types of nature loss based on a waterfall approach that considers: \n– A client-level assessment, based on the relevant environmental ratings, when available  \n– A sector and country assessment, which identifies companies active in sectors with high impact or high dependency on \nnature that are domiciled in vulnerable countries \n \n \n"}

However, DWS has not published a standalone climate transition \nplan. \nDWS will continue to monitor the developments on evolving market standards concerning appropriate disclosures on \nclimate transition plans. This will inform its approach and timing going forward. \nImpact, risk and opportunity management    \nESRS E1-2, ESRS E1-3  \nDWS´s Net Zero thematic engagement program was initiated in 2021 as part of the commitment to the Net Zero Asset \nManagers initiative and the selection criteria for engagement with investee companies have been refined over the past \nyears.  \nIn 2024, for Net Zero thematic engagement, DWS identified a number of investee companies from High Climate Impact \nSectors based on several climate-related criteria. These included their involvement in thermal coal activities, as well as \ntheir contribution to the overall weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of DWS´s Net Zero in-scope portfolios, with \nadditional consideration for companies in certain sectors with material Scope 3 emissions intensity. The entities whose \ninvestee companies are in scope for Net Zero engagement are DWS Investment GmbH, DWS International GmbH, DWS \nInvestment S.A. and DWS CH AG.  \nAs a result of the refined selection method, DWS sent 30 Net Zero thematic engagement letters to new companies, as well \nas to companies that had previously not responded to DWS´s requests.  \nIn 2024, DWS conducted thematic net-zero engagements. The majority of these meetings were follow-ups primarily aimed \nat assessing the companies’ progress on implementing their climate strategies, setting science-based targets, and \nenhancing the transparency of their disclosure in line with international standards. \nDWS has the following list of policies to support its Portfolio Net Zero approach: \nESG Integration Policy: The policy defines and governs the incorporation of sustainability risks and opportunities into \nDWS´s Active investment processes. For more details, please refer to “Sustainable Finance – Asset Management” chapter \nof this Sustainability Statement.  \nProxy Voting Policy: The EMEA Proxy Voting Policy outlines DWS´s proxy voting guidelines and offers detailed information \nregarding under which circumstances DWS would vote against certain agenda items at investee company annual general \nmeetings (AGM) for example voting on climate-related proposals. For more details, please refer to the “Sustainable Finance \n– Asset Management” chapter in this Sustainability Statement.  \nCoal Policy: The DWS Coal Policy follows on from DWS´s Net Zero commitment and is designed to reduce investments in \nand funding of thermal coal-related activities. In-scope products of the policy are restricted from investing in Coal \ndevelopers and companies with coal share of revenues greater than 25%. In addition, the policy seeks a complete phase \nout of thermal coal use from EU/OECD countries by 2030 and rest of the world by 2040.  \nGlobal Sustainability Framework for DWS Private Real Estate Investment Management: The Global Sustainability \nFramework (GSF) for DWS Private Real Estate Investment Management sets out key principles and processes concerning \nDWS Private Real Estate’s approach to consideration sustainability in the private real estate investment management.

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 316, "text": " \n284 \nDeutsche Bank  \nEnvironmental information \nAnnual Report 2024 \nClimate change \nMetrics and targets \nESRS 2 MDR-M, ESRS 2 MDR-T \nAs a signatory to the NZAM initiative, in 2021 DWS set itself an interim 2030 target of reducing the WACI of its in-scope \nassets under management by 50% relative to the baseline year of 2019, on an inflation-adjusted basis.  \nIn January 2025, NZAM launched a review of the initiative to ensure NZAM remains fit for purpose in the new global context. \nAs the initiative undergoes this review, it has suspended its activities. DWS aims to regularly review its approach to reflect \nchanging regulatory, market and client developments as appropriate. In that context, DWS seeks to also consider the final \noutcomes of the NZAM review.  \nDWS applies the inflation-adjusted WACI instead of the standard WACI to strip out the effect of price increases from the \ndecarbonization metric. Otherwise, a nominal increase in revenues due to inflation would lead to a reduction in the financial \ncarbon intensity of companies, although there is no decarbonization in real terms. The surge in inflation in recent years has \nhighlighted the importance of adopting this approach.  \nIn the 2019 baseline, the WACI amounted to 170.2 tons of CO2 equivalents per million $ of revenue (“tCO2e/mn$”). In 2022, \nthis has changed to 101.4 tons of CO2e/mn$. Stripping out the effect of inflation, this amounts to an inflation-adjusted \nreduction of 33.6% over three years.  \nDue to a lag in reporting and availability of emissions data, these calculations are based on DWS´s portfolio holdings as of \nyear-end 2023 using the emissions data from the previous year of those respective holding companies, which is 2022. \nSimilarly, the baseline figure was based on year-end 2020 portfolio holdings and 2019 emissions.  \nThe change in WACI of DWS´s portfolios is the combined result of three main underlying effects:  \n– Changes to portfolio holdings due to fund flows, market movements, or other portfolio considerations  \n– Changes to the carbon intensity of holding companies themselves  \n– Changes to the product mix, i.e. existing products being closed or new product launches \nThe 33.6% inflation-adjusted cumulative decrease in WACI over the first three years represents significant progress \ntowards DWS´s 50% reduction target by 2030. However, in the short-term, the WACI metric can be affected by external \nfactors like security price movements and client flows that are beyond the control of DWS and its investee companies. As \nthese factors can introduce volatility to the metric on a year-on-year basis, DWS does not expect the path of WACI \nreduction to follow a linear trend. This short-term volatility notwithstanding, DWS remains committed to its 2030 interim \ntarget of a 50% inflation-adjusted WACI reduction.  \nIn 2024, the absolute scope 3 portfolio emissions (in tCO2e) excl. Sovereigns was 26,046,373 and the absolute scope 3 \nportfolio emissions (in tCO2e) for sovereigns was 23,655,494.  \nThe absolute financed emissions provided are calculated for DWS´s holdings in the asset classes of equities, corporate \nbonds (including use of proceeds bonds), sovereign debt and direct real estate. Financed emissions from holdings in sub-\nsovereign debt, fund of fund holdings, investments in real estate debt and Illiquid infrastructure equity and debt \ninvestments are not included in this calculation. \nData for emissions of holdings in liquid investments i.e. equities and corporate and sovereign bonds is sourced from third-\nparty data providers. These include emissions of CO2 as well as several other greenhouse gases converted to their CO2 \nequivalent using their 100-year Global warming potential. For most of DWS´s AuM, the emissions data provided by data \nvendors is based on the numbers reported by the issuer, while the rest is estimated by the data provider according to their \nmethodology. \nDWS´s apportioned emissions are calculated using an attribution factor determined by the ratio between its outstanding \nholdings (numerator) and either Enterprise Value Including Cash for corporate issuers or GDP for sovereign issuers \n(denominator). \nScope 1 and 2 emissions of DWS´s holding companies are included, while the scope 3 emissions are not. For sovereign \ndebt, the Scope 1 emissions reported include Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry. \nFinanced emissions for DWS´s direct real estate holdings are calculated according to Global Real Estate Sustainability \nBenchmark, which is aligned with Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials, and Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor. DWS \nreports financed emissions for its entire real estate holdings including residential and not just commercial real estate. \nHowever, emissions for real estate debt portfolios are not included in its reporting. \n"}

The strategy focuses on employee excellence as well as leadership \nand puts emphasis on increased individual accountability within a streamlined governance structure to increase \neffectiveness. It aims to ensure a technology- and data-competent, high-performance workforce. The bank’s people \nstrategy is set out to drive continuous and sustainable workforce transformation along changing business demands and \nsocietal impacts. \nThe people strategy is operationalized into a HR functional strategy as the master plan for the HR organization. With \nprofessional skills, knowledge, experience, creativity, and commitment the HR function aims to provide professional \nadvice, excellent HR products and services to business divisions and infrastructure functions. In consideration of the \neconomic and regulatory environment the bank operates in, HR aims to anticipate future developments and develop \ninnovative HR concepts. The HR function recognizes and emphasizes leadership as key for employee growth as well as \ntransformation and promotes a constructive dialogue between leaders and their employees. The HR functional strategy \nsupports the bank’s ambition to become and remain employer of choice for existing and future employees. As the bank \nbelieves that talent is found everywhere and in wide variety, it is committed to attract diverse talent and ensure a working \nenvironment that is free of discrimination based on an individual’s race, color, sex, national origin, ethnicity, age, religion, \ndisability, marital status, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, citizenship or any characteristic \nprotected by law.  \nBoth the people strategy as well as the HR functional strategy are reviewed, at least annually, by the HR function in close \ncooperation with the global HR Leadership team and are refined if any need for revision or action is identified.

Deutsche Bank through its HR function manages its material impacts, risks and \nopportunities related to its own workforce through policies and procedures as well as by defining and performing key \nactions and defining and monitoring metrics, including the material ones from ESRS S1, as well as entity-specific ones. \nWith all these steps the bank aims to manage its workforce and achieve the intended working conditions and ensure \nequitable treatment and opportunities as outlined in all of the following sub-chapters of the “Own workforce” chapter. At \nleast once a year the HR function reviews the impacts, risks and opportunities related to the bank’s own workforce to \nidentify any need for revision of strategy and how it manages its own workforce and act upon it. \nESRS 2 SBM-3, ESRS S1-3, ESRS S1-4, ESRS 2 MDR-A \nDeutsche Bank relies on a motivated workforce with excellent and diverse skills, with its employees thinking from the client \nperspective and reflecting the communities in which the bank operates. Therefore, it is pivotal to the bank to provide equal \nand fair opportunities and to ensure equitable treatment of its workforce and manage its related material impacts, risks \nand opportunities. The bank can have a positive impact on its employees’ engagement and retention as well as on the \npublic by providing and promoting an inclusive working environment with fair compensation including non-financial \nbenefits, attractive and accessible training offerings for all genders, and no tolerance of discrimination or harassment. \nDeutsche Bank has made a public commitment working towards gender equality and increasing the representation of \ndiverse talent also in its leadership ranks, in part to reflect respective German legislation, otherwise this could lead to a \nnegative impact.  \nDeutsche Bank has set itself specific goals to drive behavioral change, undertakes various actions and has received public \nrecognition for its efforts.

Investing in \nemployee initiatives presents Deutsche Bank with the opportunity for a nexus of Social Good and Good-for-Business. If \nthe bank failed to ensure equal treatment and opportunities and to avoid discriminatory practices for its employees this \nwould represent a risk, which could manifest in not meeting the bank's diversity goals, including the representation of \ndiverse talent in senior management positions, as well as litigation costs or reputational damage to the bank. Besides that, \na lack of an inclusive and attractive working environment and equal opportunities for all employees could lead to a risk of \ndecreased employee engagement and financial underperformance. To mitigate this risk and the risk from demographic \nchanges of filling positions when employees retire, the bank has put robust processes and measures in place to safeguard \nits own workforce against any form of discrimination, harassment or retaliation in the workplace and performs various \nactions to foster an inclusive working environment. Respective actions and targets as well as key metrics are described in \nthe sub-chapter “Diversity, equity and inclusion” of this “Own workforce” chapter.  \nFair and attractive working conditions are key to having engaged employees who feel supported and valued, so they can \nperform at their best and thrive in their careers. Deutsche Bank fosters positive impacts on its employees by assuring the \nfreedom of association for its employees, maintaining a constructive dialogue with trade unions - including the conclusion \nof collective bargaining agreements - and actively enabling the representation of employees through workers’ councils. A \nlack of assuring the freedom of association for its employees or in recognizing the right to collective bargaining would lead \nto negative impacts not only on the bank’s employees but also on the bank’s reputation. By offering its employees effective \nand attractive training and development opportunities, based on regular performance feedback and in line with changing \nskill requirements, the bank promotes its employees’ excellence. This represents opportunities for increased engagement, \nproductivity, realization of business potential and improved services towards its clients. Potential negative impacts on \nemployees’ well-being may arise from lack of adequate working time as well as from insufficient work-life balance. To \nmitigate those potential negative impacts, the bank fosters employees’ well-being through a clear well-being strategy and \nbroad benefit portfolio and is empowering employees to achieve a suitable work-life balance with appropriate working \ntime, also through flexible working arrangements and the opportunity for family-related leave. Respective actions and the \nrelated target as well as key metrics are described in the sub-chapter “Working conditions” of this “Own workforce” \nchapter. \nThe HR function is responsible for defining and performing actions to achieve the intended working conditions and ensure \nequal and fair opportunities for its employees. At least once a year, the HR function assesses the impacts, risks and \nopportunities (IRO) related to its own workforce to identify any potential need for revision and action and to ensure that \npotential changes of the workforce-related IRO-assessment are accurately reflected in the strategy, and vice versa. \nThe disclosures of this “Own workforce” chapter cover all types and groups of employees, generally including employees’ \nrepresentatives, as well as non-employees where applicable. The processes and sources to identify potential risks, \nincluding risks of harm, impacts and opportunities as well as required actions in response to actual or potential negative \nimpacts in relation to the bank’s own workforce are described in the following sub-chapters “Processes for engaging with \nown workforce and workers representatives about impacts” and “Processes to remediate negative impacts and channels \nfor own workforce to raise concerns”. These processes, as well as other data sources, such as workforce data on global or \ncountry level, enable the bank to identify potential impacts, risks and opportunities that relate to its own workforce, \nincluding specific groups of people, for example with particular characteristics or working in a particular context or in \nspecific activities. \nESRS S1-1, ESRS 2 MDR-P  \nThe bank’s policies and procedures serve as a means for Deutsche Bank to implement its people strategy and to manage \nits material impacts, risks and opportunities related to its own workforce. The policies and procedures are aligned with the \nlaws and regulations in all of the markets in which the bank operates and are set out and revised in consultation with key \npolicy stakeholders, in line with the bank’s Group-wide Policy on Requirements for Policies, Procedures, Key Operating and \nFramework Documents, which is approved by the Group General Council. In case of a material revision of the policy, the \nGlobal Portfolio Owners as well as the respective Subject Matter Experts of all affected units in the bank must be \nconsulted. The people-related policies are developed by the respective HR function in consultation with the respective \nkey policy stakeholders (depending on the scope of the policy, this could involve functions like Performance & Reward, \nEmployment Relations, HR Risk & Control) and are aligned with applicable labor laws in the different jurisdictions in which \nthe bank operates, including anti-discrimination laws. Moreover, workers’ representatives as key stakeholders are involved \nsubject to their participation rights, for example the German Works Constitution Act (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz), and \nworks agreements (Betriebsvereinbarungen) may be concluded, if applicable. HR’s global policies are approved by the \nGlobal Head of HR and reviewed at least annually. The policies are available to the bank’s employees and non-employees \non the bank’s internal Policy Portal which is linked to the bank’s intranet start page. When a policy or procedure is newly \nissued or updated, a news article is published on the intranet, highlighting key changes, consequences, and contact point \nfor questions.

The bank’s actions are often global activities or programs that apply to all employees in all \nregions of the bank, like global learning offerings or leadership programs, but there are also actions which are specific to a \nregion or division, for example apprenticeship programs or offering childcare offering in the bank’s major global hubs, as \nwell as actions which are specific to certain employee groups, such as talent programs for female or Black employees. The \nimplementation of these actions contributes to achieving the bank’s people strategy and targets, foster attractive and fair \nworking conditions and provide and ensure equitable treatment and opportunities. Actions conducted by the bank have \nvarious time-horizons, from long-term, like the actions associated with the 35 by 25 program, with the evolution of the \ncompensation and performance framework or with the establishment of new trainings, to occasion-related, one-time \nmeasures, such as the Ask me anything-session series. For planning and implementation of the bank’s actions, the required \nresources, such as working time of employees and/or financial budget, are allocated to the actions. The bank’s actions are \ndescribed throughout the following sub-chapters on “Workforce management”, “Working conditions”, and “Diversity, \nequity and inclusion”. Progress of these actions and action plans, including those initiated in prior periods, are monitored \nby the bank by various qualitative and quantitative means, including metrics reported in the following sub-chapters and \nthe results of the annual People Survey. \nProcesses for engaging with own workforce and workers’ representatives about impacts \nESRS S1-2, ESRS S1-1 \nEngagement with own workforce \nThe bank is committed to comprehensively reflect its employees’ views in decisions that may have an impact on its own \nworkforce and provides various channels to engage with its own workforce directly to gain insights into their perception, \npotential concerns and positive or negative impacts that may affect them.  \nThe central means of information gathering is the bank’s voluntary and confidential People Survey, which is facilitated to \nunderstand its employees’ perspectives around what the bank is doing well and where its employees perceive need for \nimprovement. Deutsche Bank aims to gain a differentiated view across various areas and employee groups in the bank and \nto identify groups amongst its employees who may have a particular exposure to negative impacts. Therefore, survey \nresults show regional and divisional cuts and result segmentation by further criteria, based on the voluntary and \nconfidential option to answer demographic questions on topics such as age, gender and tenure, as well as, in certain \ngeographies, on ethnicity and sexual orientation. By observing the participation rate in the survey, the bank also assesses \nthe effectiveness of this channel. In 2024, the survey received its highest participation rate since 2011 with 65% (2023: \n64%) of invited employees taking part, which, based on vendor feedback, is in line with the bank’s peers. \nThe People Survey measures progress on employee commitment (including intent to stay at the bank, pride, motivation, \nadvocacy of the organization as an employer) and enablement (level of challenge and interest in work, degree to which \nemployees can be productive) by asking all employees to provide feedback on a broad range of topics around the bank’s \nworking conditions, such as communication, digitalization, diversity, equity and inclusion, ethics and speak up and \nresources. Employees are also asked about purpose and enjoyment at work and the degree to which they feel supported \nby the bank in achieving a reasonable balance between work life and personal life. The People Survey also provides insights \ninto employees’ comfort to express their views freely and what helps or stops them expressing themselves. Employees can \nalso use free text fields included in the survey to share improvement proposals or observations and thus use the survey to \nprovide feedback on the positive and negative aspects of their working experience at the bank. In 2024 Deutsche Bank \nintroduced a new academic partner to support the bank’s ambitions to further enhance insights through advanced \nanalytics to gain more detailed, actionable insights to improve the employee experience. \nA dedicated HR team prepares, continuously reviews, evolves, and runs the survey under the guidance of the Global Head \nof HR and with the Management Board’s approval. To protect employee confidentiality and facilitate open \nfeedback, results are only reported at an aggregated level. The survey results are reported to the Management Board and \nthe Group Management Committee to inform their decision making and associated actions. Survey results are also shared \nwith the respective business divisions and infrastructure functions, which are required to plan improvement actions, if \nneeded, as explained in the “Culture, integrity and conduct” chapter. The dedicated HR team ensures that insights from \nthe results are considered in the continuous review and refinement of the bank’s people strategy. \nThe People Survey results show that feedback conversations (once a month or more frequently) make a positive difference \nto employees’ motivation and perceived productivity. As a result, in addition to the People Survey, HR administers a Culture \nPulse survey three times per year to help the bank understand the frequency and quality of upward and downward \nfeedback, team meetings, appreciation and the level to which employees encounter productive behaviors in their \nworking environment. This survey results provides a Culture Pulse Index which is included in the balanced scorecard \nreporting. Key results of the people surveys are shared with the works councils and employees. \n"}

Generally, all articles published can be liked via a button and commented via a \nfree text field, with comments being visible to all. By monitoring the statistics of views and interactions with the articles \ne.g. through comments or evaluations of an article, the bank assesses the reach and the effectiveness of this channel. \nMoreover, employees can address their questions in the regular divisional and regional Townhall events. In 2024, a series \nof Ask me anything-sessions was run, where the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Management Board answered \nemployees’ questions, which could be either pre-submitted or asked anonymously via a Questions & Answers functionality \nin the live session.  \nEngagement with workers’ representatives \nBesides this direct engagement with the workforce, another important process in gaining insight into its employees’ \nperspective is the bank’s continuous dialogue with employee representative bodies with which the bank maintains an open \nand constructive exchange. Worldwide, the bank cooperates with employee representatives and their councils based on \neach country’s legislation. In Germany, for example, where the majority of the bank’s employees are based (42%), the Works \nConstitution Act (Betriebsverfassungsgesetz, BetrVG) governs the involvement of works councils by stipulating their rights \nand duties and by prescribing the cases and form in which employers are required to involve a works council. Works \ncouncils, whose members are elected every four years, represent employees’ interests through discussions and \nnegotiations with Deutsche Bank. The bank’s executive employees have their own representative committee, which is \nlikewise governed by German law (Sprecherausschussgesetz). Discussions with those representative bodies take place as \nrequired for implementing certain measures. Beyond that, the bank is in constant contact with employee representatives \nto maintain an internal dialogue and gather a sense of the employees’ views and their representatives’ perspective towards \npotential negative impacts on the bank’s employees. In Germany, the bank has concluded or updated several group works \nagreements in 2024, for example, on the refined Performance and Compensation Framework or Artificial Intelligence \napplications, as well as general or local works agreements, for example with regard to hybrid working arrangements.  \nDeutsche Bank employees are also represented on a European level. Based on the agreement on cross-border information \nand consultation of Deutsche Bank employees in the EU, concluded on September 10, 1996, the European Works Council \nrepresents employees working in all EU countries.  \nProcesses to remediate negative impacts and channels for own workforce to raise concerns \nESRS S1-1, ESRS S1-3, ESRS G1-1, ESRS 2 MDR-P \nDeutsche Bank has established a whistleblowing framework that is available to the bank‘s own workforce to raise concerns. \nThis is to ensure that all concerns or perceived negative impacts on the bank's own workforce are brought to attention and \nactions can be taken if required. The framework is governed by the Group-wide, global Raising Concerns (including \nWhistleblowing) Policy, which is approved by the Group Chief Compliance Officer. The policy sets out the bank’s approach \nfor raising concerns and applies to all employees and non-employees, as described in the chapter “Culture, integrity and \nconduct”. Deutsche Bank prohibits retaliation in any form against any individual because they raise concerns internally or \nexternally, assist in raising a concern, or cooperate in an investigation into a concern. \nIn case grievances are raised, the relevant functions responsible for addressing the concerns are involved and handle and \naction them, including tracking the effectiveness of their actions. Grievances or complaints raised concerning any negative \nimpacts on the bank’s own workforce or pertaining to misconduct of its own workforce, including Human Rights related \nconcerns, are investigated by one of the bank’s relevant investigative functions, depending on the nature of the allegation. \nIf any human rights related concerns are raised, Deutsche Bank’s Head of Human Rights must be informed. Justified and \ncredible concerns trigger an investigation process that includes investigative steps, research, and consultation on the \nalleged concern. Depending on the outcomes of such due diligence, appropriate measures are agreed upon and \nimplemented to remediate existing impacts. In every case where there is a potential disciplinary case to answer, the matter \nmust be referred to HR and is handled in line with the global, Group-wide Performance, Consequences and Reward Policy \nand handled in accordance with local laws, with actions taken where appropriate by the HR team dedicated to employee \nrelations. This is regardless of the channels these concerns are reported through, e.g., the Whistleblowing channels, the \nHR function, managers or any other channel. Follow-up actions may include but are not limited to, policy changes, process \nand control enhancements, lessons learned reviews or disciplinary measures, depending on the severity and \ncircumstances, as described in the sub-chapter “Incidents and complaints” of the “Own workforce” chapter. The bank \nstrives to make disciplinary decisions in a consistent and transparent way. Regular reporting on trends and themes of \nconcerns as well as any action taken in consequence, e.g., disciplinary measures, is provided to the Global HR Leadership \nTeam as well as the Culture, Integrity and Conduct governance team.  \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 323, "text": " \n291 \nDeutsche Bank  \nSocial Information \nAnnual Report 2024 \nOwn workforce \nTo assess how effective and trusted by employees the bank’s channels to raise concerns are, the annual People Survey \nasks employees for voluntary and confidential feedback to gauge the awareness of employees of the channels to raise \nconcerns and the confidence that a potential concern would be addressed effectively and handled confidentially by the \nbank. Within the survey itself, employees are directed via a link to the Raise a Concern page should they have a \nconcern they would like to raise. Results of the 2024 survey showed that employees continue to experience an \nenvironment that lives up to the bank’s standards with the vast majority feeling able to express themselves. The results \nalso demonstrated that, while the number of employees having concerns is low, the vast majority would know how to raise \na concern should they have one.  \nIn addition to the People Survey and Culture Pulse Survey, the bank runs a voluntary and confidential Exit Survey of \nvoluntary leavers primarily designed to understand their reasons for leaving, their experience of working for the bank, and \nto identify potential exposure to negative impacts for potentially vulnerable groups among the bank’s employees. To \nassess the trust in and effectiveness of the channels, respondents of the Exit Survey are asked if they had any concerns \nthey could have raised in the preceding twelve months, whether they raised them or not, and if not, the reason for not \nraising it. Respondents are given the option of leaving contact details for confidential follow-up by a member of the bank’s \nindependent Whistleblowing Central Function. The Whistleblowing Central Function conducts voluntary and confidential \nNew Joiner and Speak-Up surveys at 30 and 90 days after an employee joins the bank, respectively. The content of these \nsurveys is the same, but they are sent at different time intervals to proactively identify potential areas of concern, including \nthose affecting potentially vulnerable groups. Like the Exit Survey, both surveys include questions relating to Speak-Up \nculture, awareness and raising concerns. \nEmployee feedback culture  \nESRS S1-4, ESRS S1-5, ESRS 2 MDR-A, ESRS 2 MDR-T \nDeutsche Bank puts care into hiring the right people, developing them, and ensuring they have the relevant skills. In turn, \nthe bank’s employees need to be heard, included, recognized, cared for, and provided with positive leadership to foster a \nproductive working environment, in which, strong relationships, open communication, and learning from feedback play an \nessential role.  \nAs outlined in the sub-chapter “Processes for engaging with own workforce and workers representatives about impacts” \nof the “Own workforce” chapter, the bank uses confidential employee surveys and further channels to gather the different \nperspectives of its own workforce to understand what the bank is doing well and where it needs to make improvements.  \nA key element of the employee feedback culture is the annual People Survey which measures progress on employee \ncommitment and enablement by asking all employees to provide feedback on a broad range of topics around the bank’s \nworking conditions. Employee commitment encompasses the intent to stay at the bank, pride, motivation, as well as the \nadvocacy of the organization as an employer. The commitment score decreased to 67% (excluding Russian Federation) \nfrom 70% in 2023. The enablement score decreased to 70% from 71% in 2023. The downward trend in the scores is \ninfluenced by the bank’s ongoing transformation activities. While pride in working for the organization is stable, other \nquestions contributing to commitment such as intent to stay and advocacy of Deutsche Bank as an employer decreased. \nAt the same time, the intrinsic motivation of the bank’s employees, their willingness to go above and beyond, remains at a \nvery high level, indicative of a high-performance organization. The results from the People Survey are shared with the \nManagement Board and Supervisory Board, which identifies key focus areas for action, and results are used to inform the \nmandatory divisional culture plans as part of the bank’s Culture, Integrity, and Conduct initiative. In 2024, the Management \nBoard identified four key focus areas for the bank to address with targeted initiatives: Strategy and Transformation (e.g., \nprocess improvements and communication), Leadership (e.g., manager curricula), Sustainable Career Development (e.g., \nindividual growth), and Performance and Feedback (e.g., sustainable performance culture).  \nAdditionally, the bank runs a Culture Pulse survey three times a year to maintain a continuous understanding of important \naspects of employees’ workplace perceptions. In 2024, feedback and productive behaviors in the working environment \nwere taken into focus. The survey helps the bank understand the frequency and quality of feedback from managers to \nemployees, team meetings, and the level to which employees encounter productive behaviors in their working \nenvironment. Results from the 2023 People Survey identified new areas of focus. On this basis, two new questions about \ncontinuous improvement and positive acknowledgement were introduced in 2024. The results provide a Culture Pulse Key \nPerformance Indicator for which the Group-wide target for 2024 was 70%, as agreed by the Management Board, with a \nyear end result of 69.89%. \n \n \n"}

Effective own workforce management plays a vital role in \nachieving transformational goals and includes supporting managers in performing their daily tasks, from recruitment to \ndevelopment and providing data driven insights to senior management, which will in turn support strategy as well as \nplanning activity and enable better informed decisions. An important part of achieving this objective is continuous \ninvestment in technology and modern infrastructure. HR continues to develop and expand its state-of-the-art software \nfor workforce analysis and planning – a strategic innovation to support the bank’s innovation and digital agenda. Managers \nare provided with people analytics and a workforce planning solution, based on pre-built, best practice questions about \nthe workforce. This allows to predict various scenarios, present different options to executives and choose a path for \nachieving certain goals. To support Deutsche Bank’s global initiatives, regulatory needs, as well as strategy and planning, \nthe bank’s overarching objective going forward is more evidence-based management of the bank’s people and workforce \nagenda.

Deutsche Bank strives for a close and constructive cooperation with employee representatives \nand social partners which is characterized by mutual trust. As of December 31, 2024, Germany is the only country in the \nEuropean Economic Area having significant employment in the sense of the ESRS S1, i.e., at least 50 employees by \nheadcount representing at least 10% of Deutsche Bank’s total employees. Employees in Germany represent 42.0% of the \nbank’s total number of employees in headcount. In Germany, 55.7% of all employees are covered by collective bargaining \nagreements (2023 aligned to ESRS S1 definition: 57.5%). This includes civil servants, who have a similar level of regulation \nand protection by federal law. Outside the European Economic Area, India (region Asia Pacific) is the only country that \nreaches the threshold of significant employment. None of the employees of Deutsche Bank is affiliated to any union in \nIndia in line with market practice. Therefore, the bank’s employees in India are not covered by collective bargaining \nagreements. \nDeutsche Bank maintains close and steady relations with workers’ representatives. In Germany, the only European \nEconomic Area (EEA) country with significant employment, 96% of all employees are covered by works councils/works \ncouncil agreements (2023: 96%). Such representation takes place on the local, company and/or Group level. The remaining \n4% of German employees are executive employees which are represented by a representative committee \n(Sprecherausschuss) according to the German Executives’ Committee Act (Sprecherausschussgesetz) on company and/or \nGroup level (2023: 4%). Therefore, in Germany, 100% of employees are covered by workers’ representatives. In 2024, the \nbank in Germany concluded several group works agreements, for example, on the further developed compensation and \nperformance framework or the application of artificial intelligence, as well as general works agreements, for example, on \nhybrid work. \nDeutsche Bank employees are also represented on a European level as highlighted in the above section “Engagement with \nworkers representatives” of the “Own workforce” chapter. \nCollective bargaining coverage and social dialogue  \nDec 31, 2024 \nCollective Bargaining Coverage \nSocial dialogue \nCoverage Rate \nEmployees – EEA (for \ncountries with >50 \nemployees representing \n>10% of total employees) \nEmployees – Non-EEA \n(estimate for regions \nwith >50 employees \nrepresenting \n>10% of total employees) \nWorkplace representation \n(EEA only) (for countries \nwith >50 employees \nrepresenting \n>10% of total employees) \n0-19% \nIndia \n20-39% \n40-59% \nGermany \n60-79% \n80-100% \nGermany \n \n \nAs part of transformation and optimization activities, Deutsche Bank is implementing numerous projects and measures. \nWhere this involves restructuring and employee reductions, Deutsche Bank remains committed to implement these in a \ntransparent and socially responsible manner – including involvement from the works council if applicable. Restructuring \nmeasures generally provide an appropriate notice period for employees. Termination periods (as well as consultation or \nnegotiation requirements, if such apply) reflect the legal norm in each country, such as laws, collective bargaining \nagreements, employee handbooks, and/or individual employment contracts. In Germany, tariff employees are subject to \nthe termination periods laid down in the respective collective bargaining agreements. In contrast, non-tariff employees \nare subject to contractual or statutory termination periods.  \nThe bank’s approach to organizational change is holistic and embedded in its social plan, which under German law is an \ninstrument to compensate or mitigate economic disadvantages suffered by employees resulting from organizational \nchange. Its purpose is to support employees affected by restructuring measures by enhancing their employability and \noffering them individually tailored coaching. Employees, managers, members of the works council, and HR advisors \ninvolved in change processes have access to a comprehensive set of measures. In addition, the approach supports the \nbank’s strategy to fill open jobs with suitable internal candidates and to utilize a network of specialist firms to identify job \nopportunities outside the organization. \nTalent development \nESRS S1-13 \nOffering opportunities to learn and grow is a key component of attractive working conditions, therefore the bank fosters \ncontinuous learning, promotes its talents through specific development programs and succession planning, and ensures \nthat up-to-date records on recruitment, training and promotion are kept and are available for employees to track their \nprogress on learning, training and career progression. \n"}

Therefore, the Leadership Kompass has evolved, aligning four of the eight behaviors directly \nto the aspirational culture to reinforce the connection, and the remaining four behaviors aligning to a leader’s critical role \nin managing people.  \nThe new All-Managers Curriculum, launched in July 2024, is a carefully selected and targeted set of development \nopportunities for all full- and part-time people managers. It focuses on the key skills of feedback, coaching, career- and \ndevelopment conversations. It also contains the workshop Leading Inclusively, which covers the impact of unconscious \nbias on decision-making as well as ways to make Deutsche Bank a more equitable workplace where all employees feel \nvalued. In 2024, about 1,400 managers participated in this dynamic and modular offering.

Employees \neligible for variable compensation must set SMART priorities, link these to the bank’s strategic goals and agree them with \ntheir manager at the start of the performance year to give focus and direction for the year ahead. Regular conversations \nand continuous feedback, including the use of optional tools including upward feedback, anytime feedback, and 360 \nfeedback for in-scope employees, during the year enable the bank’s employees to think about their performance and, if \nnecessary, make changes to achieve sustainable success. The bank tracks employee receipt of regular feedback from their \nmanager via the regular Culture Pulse Survey. The bank’s holistic approach to managing performance holds both \nemployees and their managers accountable and is adequately reflected in variable compensation decisions.  \nIt is mandatory for all active and in scope employees (whether full-time or part-time) to have one documented performance \nreview annually. The review is multi-dimensional and includes evidence of achievements by the employee in their role, of \ntheir pre-defined priorities (objectives/goals) and how they have demonstrated the required behaviors and conduct. Career \ndevelopment is employee-led, and an employee-manger discussion is encouraged at least once annually, but it is not \nrequired to formally document this.

Variable compensation is \nawarded based on a variable compensation orientation framework and is closely linked to individual performance metrics, \nsuch as the delivery of business priorities set at the beginning of the performance year, as well as conduct and behavior.  \nThe Annual total remuneration ratio compares the annual total remuneration of the highest paid employee to the median \nannual total remuneration for all employees (excluding the highest paid employee).

In \naddition, the bank provides breastfeeding/lactation facilities in many of its locations. The bank also offers flexibility in \nworking arrangements, through hybrid work model, flexible work hours, part-time and job-sharing opportunities, subject \nto specific role requirements and client needs. A variety of paid and unpaid leave is available to allow employees to manage \nunforeseen events, such as taking care of the elderly or sickness of children. In several locations, non-primary caregivers \nare also eligible for family leave. \n96% of the bank’s employees globally are entitled to family-related leave: maternity or paternity leave, parental leave and \ncarers’ leave. This can be either a discretionary offering or due to statutory requirements. Amongst the employees who are \nentitled to family related leave, 20.7% took leave of one or more types of leave in 2024.

Eligible employees can work \nremotely up to two days a week, depending on their role and function, as determined by divisional and country guidelines. \nThese guidelines ensure a consistent employee experience and a transparent framework while accommodating flexibility. \nDivisional guidelines provide global guidance on remote working eligibility, which employees can use as a basis for \nindividual conversations with their managers. These guidelines must be implemented alongside any specific country \nguidelines, which cover country eligibility and the local regulatory framework for remote work. In case of a difference \nbetween divisional and country guidelines, the latter applies. \nHybrid working arrangements are reviewed annually with employees to ensure that functions and teams are actively \nreflecting on the most appropriate hybrid working arrangements.

The goal is to embed health and \nwell-being at the heart of the bank’s culture. Deutsche Bank wants to proactively empower its employees to prioritize their \nown well-being and support those around them in doing the same. Health and well-being are about everyday behaviors, \nbased on the following four dimensions: physically thriving, emotionally and mentally balanced, socially connected and \nfinancially secure. \nThe bank is working continuously to align its well-being offerings with the benefit portfolios, diversity, equity and inclusion \ninitiatives, the hybrid working model and the Talent and Development agenda, including leadership development, to share \nbest practices across the organization, and implement the well-being agenda in line with the bank’s governance and cost \nrequirements. As from 2024, the reflection of employees well-being in everyday working-life is part of the bank’s Code of \nConduct. \nTo make the bank’s well-being offerings more transparent, raise awareness and be better aligned across divisions and \nregions the Deutsche Bank Global Well-being Hub is available to all employees and non-employees. The hub brings \ntogether an array of existing resources, initiatives, and benefits from across the bank into one place, making it easier for \nthe bank’s own workforce to find information on places to go for support (for example Employee Assistance Program 24 \nhour hotline, Mental Health First Aider, company doctors, etc.) or for resources about personal development. There are \nalso several useful hints on how to boost well-being.  \nEmployees’ mental health remained a priority in 2024. The number of Mental Health First Aiders – employees who \nvolunteer to actively support their colleagues’ mental health – increased to 737 aiders in 2024 (2023: 583) and are \norganized in an international working group to better coordinate their efforts. In addition, the bank offers an in-house \neLearning module on mental health awareness to all employees and a new tailor-made Manager e-learning, covering Well-\nbeing (self and others), Hybrid Working and Meeting Culture, with over 1,000 managers enrolled since the launch in July \n2024. By integrating well-being into Deutsche Bank’s everyday culture, the bank aims to enable and empower all \nemployees to better look after their own and their colleagues’ well-being and to contribute to improve productivity and \nemployee satisfaction. The message It’s ok not to be ok is included in senior management communication and events \nacross the platform on a regular basis.  \nTo emphasize the top of the house commitment to employee well-being, the Group Management Committee appoints \nWell-being Champions in every global, divisional Leadership Team, who actively support the well-being agenda alongside \nFabrizio Campelli as Well-being Sponsor on the Management Board.  \nOn World Mental Health Day in 2024, Fabrizio Campelli, alongside the divisional Well-being Champions, reiterated the \nbank’s commitment to its well-being agenda and participated in some of the over 60 in-house events worldwide, that took \nplace as part of a World Mental Health week, as well as a Tone from the Top Video: Creating Psychological Safety together. \nDeutsche Bank also reiterated its commitment to Mental Health externally – with electronic displays and Cash Machines \nrecognizing World Mental Health Day in Germany. \nThe bank’s dedication to well-being is also recognized externally. Deutsche Bank was ranked 4th in the Top 10 ideal \nEmployers for Well-being in the latest efinancialCareers Ideal Employer Report 23/24. At the InsideOut Mental Health \nAwards 2024, Deutsche Bank was named Financial Services Employer of the Year for its outstanding mental health and \nWell-being program, which focuses on both recovery and prevention. The judges praised the bank's comprehensive \ncommitment to mental health, noting its efforts to create a future-oriented work environment. \nWork-related injuries, occupational accidents, and serious incidents like employees being killed at work are extremely rare \nat a bank and are more relevant to the safety of other industries. Deutsche Bank is committed to providing safe places to \nwork for the benefit of employees, visitors and clients. The bank believes that integrating strong environment, health and \nsafety practices into its business has multiple positive effects. A continued focus and stewardship of safety topics \ncontributes to improving productivity in the workplace and increases overall employee satisfaction. The bank publishes a \nglobal Environment, Health and Safety Policy, which sets out the respective requirements for employees and controls to \nensure workplace accident prevention. This includes assistive appliances and workstation assessments, first aid, fire safety, \nbuilding evacuation plans and floor wardens. The policy is approved by the bank’s Chief Security Officer and reviewed at \nleast annually. Senior management remains committed to furthering safety programs across the bank, a commitment \nemphasized by the formation of governance for providing oversight, support and advocacy of the safety of everyone at \nthe bank.  \n"}

Trainings on specific \ndiversity, equity and inclusion matters covered in related policies are offered, partly on a mandatory basis, such as the \ntraining for the Code of Conduct, and partly for specific groups such as, Inclusive hiring manager training, First time \nmanager training and Leading inclusively training, as described in the “Talent development” section of the “Own \nworkforce” chapter. \nA dedicated HR team is responsible for setting and driving the bank’s diversity, equity and inclusion vision, global strategy \nand multi-year roadmap, and defining the associated annual priorities. The Management Board and the Group \nManagement Committee endorse the bank’s diversity, equity and inclusion vision and strategy, and monitor progress \nagainst the agreed goals and objectives. The central team activates leaders and employees to sustainably support the \ndiversity, equity and inclusion strategy and to make progress against the set objectives.  \nThe bank’s promotion and appointment decisions are based on merit, including candidates’ suitability for a role, their \npotential, and their demonstrated performance.  \nThroughout 2024, the bank continued to embed diversity, equity and inclusion in its culture and people practices. This \nincludes targeted outreach to attract and hire diverse talent, enhanced career planning, leadership development, exposure \nopportunities and senior leader sponsorship.  \nThe bank has a variety of impactful flagship development programs that support diverse talent globally, such as ATLAS, \nWomen Global Leaders, and dbBOLD, as outlined in the following sections. \nThe bank continues to equip its employees with resources to practice inclusion and understand how to make equitable \npeople-related decisions.

The bank aims to have women \nrepresent at least 35% of its Managing Director, Director, and Vice President population globally by 2025 (business \ndivisions and infrastructure functions excluding Asset Management), known as ’35 by 25’. This goal also forms part of the \nkey performance indicators on the Balanced Scorecard assessing the Management Board and Group Management \nCommittee. In 2021, the goal was publicly announced after consultation with the Supervisory Board which includes \nemployee representatives among others. The goal was based on workforce data modeling and assumptions on the female \nshare in hiring, promotion and turnover using 2020 data as a baseline. The 35 by 25 program is sponsored and actively \nsupported by the Management Board and Group Management Committee. Since 2023, each of the bank's decision-making \ncommittees is required to regularly review its composition to improve diversity of thought and support the bank's \ncommitment to increase the proportion of women in senior, decision making roles.

The \nAccomplished Top Leaders Advancement Strategy (ATLAS) talent development program is aimed at accelerating the \nreadiness of senior, high-potential women to take on broader roles in the organization and increasing the number of women \nin senior, influential positions across the bank. The program encompasses a mixture of capability building in strategically \nrelevant topics, leadership development as well as increased exposure and profile. Another aspect of this program is to \nleverage the power of each cohort to collaborate and invest in other women’s talent networks to foster collaboration \nacross divisions and empower women to act as a catalyst for change.  \nThese talent development programs play an important role in the bank’s progress toward its diversity goals. The Director \ntalent acceleration development program, for example, has a Women Global Leaders module. It draws on research to \nidentify paths for accelerating women’s career growth and provides personal guidance on strengthening vital leadership \nnetworks. Its overall aim is to empower participants to maximize their impact as leaders and to further grow their careers. \nMore details on leadership and talent development are included in the “Talent development” section of the “Working \nconditions” sub-chapter of this “Own workforce” chapter. \nThe talent acceleration alumni group, created in 2020, aims to continue the engagement with the bank’s top talent, even \nafter they have completed their acceleration development program.

Named after Ellen Schneider-Lenné, the first woman on Deutsche \nBank’s Management Board, its vision is to create a powerful community of women leaders who are visible and active role \nmodels in the bank, to equip them with a platform and tools to drive culture change and to support the development and \nengagement of talent across the bank.  \nFor its engagement the bank was named one of The Times Top 50 Employers for Gender Equality 2024 in the U.K. \nGender pay gap \nESRS S1-16 \nDeutsche Bank recognizes that how it remunerates its employees plays a vital role in the successful delivery of the bank’s \nstrategic objectives and in maintaining a healthy culture. By aligning risk and reward and by driving the right behaviors, the \nbank’s incentive systems help to make the bank more resilient while contributing to its long-term success. A fair, \ntransparent and sustainable approach to remuneration is therefore of crucial importance to the bank, and one the bank \ncontinues to make progress on.  \nDeutsche Bank is a diverse employer operating across numerous geographies worldwide, covering four business divisions: \nPrivate Bank, Corporate and Investment Bank and Asset Management as well as operations and support functions. The \nbank has made significant progress towards its aspirational goals. These efforts include the development and alignment \nof fixed pay ranges to promote and ensure the principal of equal pay for equal work. This commitment underscores the \nbank’s dedication to fostering fairness and equity within its workforce. To continue ensuring that the bank moves in the \nright direction, it has provided further resources for the businesses and infrastructure functions to effectively utilize these \ntools and create a fair, transparent and sustainable environment.  \nThe bank has disclosed to the public or reported to the regulators on the unadjusted Gender pay gap for a number of years \nin countries where there is an existing legislative requirement. For example, in the United Kingdom, the bank published its \nseventh Gender pay gap Report in March 2024. Progress has been made with the median hourly pay gap decreasing from \n24.9% in 2022 to 24.3% in 2023 and the median bonus pay gap narrowed from 41.3% to 38.8%. In addition, the bank \nvoluntarily published its ethnicity pay gap in the United Kingdom for the fourth time. \nFor the reporting year 2024, Deutsche Bank reported its unadjusted global Gender pay gap globally for the first time to \nunderstand the extent of the gap in the pay between women and men amongst the bank’s employees globally including \nManagement Board members. The unadjusted global Gender pay gap is defined as the difference of average hourly pay \nlevels between female and male employees, expressed as percentage of the average hourly pay level of male employees. \nFor 2024, the unadjusted global Gender pay gap was 38.8%. \nA regression analysis, that considers a number of objective factors such as seniority, business division and region, results \nin an adjusted Gender pay gap of 6.0%. Therefore, the underlying reason for the unadjusted global Gender pay gap is \nprimarily linked to the lower representation of women in senior and highly remunerated roles and in higher cost locations. \nTo drive structural change and get more women into senior roles, Deutsche Bank continues to make progress on its 35 by \n25 gender diversity goal and initiatives, as described in the “Diversity, equity and inclusion” sub-chapter of the “Own \nworkforce” chapter. Whilst Deutsche Bank acknowledges there is still work to do, the effort and initiatives in place will \ncontinue and are expected to have a positive impact on the gap over time. \nAge diversity \nESRS S1-9 \nThe bank benefits from different generational perspectives and recognizes that different generations have different needs. \nThe bank provides employees with benefits and support suited to the different stages of life and career.

Its mandate is to oversee Deutsche Bank’s \nmanagement of human-rights-related matters, monitor human-rights-related trends, collect and share learnings from \nwithin Deutsche Bank, liaise with external experts, and initiate strategic human-rights-related projects. The Forum \nsupplements the bank’s established risk management and due diligence processes within its business activities and \noperations.  \nTo further strengthen its human rights management, Deutsche Bank appointed in 2023 a Head of Human Rights within \nGroup Sustainability, which forms part of the bank’s Chief Sustainability Office. He supports the management of human-\nrights-related initiatives and is responsible for advancing these initiatives throughout the bank. The role assumes \nresponsibilities for overseeing Deutsche Bank’s management of human rights and coordinating processes and \ncommunication channels to evaluate the effectiveness of the bank’s human rights management approach. Further \nresponsibilities of the Head of Human Rights include the development of overarching standards for human rights \nmanagement, defining risk management standards in collaboration with risk and other functions, coordination of strategic \nhuman rights projects, representation of Deutsche Bank in relevant networks, and acting as a point of escalation for \nhuman-rights-related concerns.  \nDeutsche Bank’s Code of Conduct defines the minimum standards of behavior and conduct to which the bank expects all \nits employees, non-employees and the bank as an organization to adhere to. The purpose of the Code of Conduct is to \nensure that the bank’s workforce conducts itself ethically, with integrity, and in accordance with the bank’s policies and \nprocedures as well as applicable laws and regulations. Beyond mere compliance, however, the bank is committed to always \ndoing what is right and proper. Deutsche Bank requires its own workforce and the members of its Management Board to \nfollow the letter and the spirit of this Code, as well as all other applicable policies and procedures to promote compliance \nwith high ethical standards. Deutsche Bank’s commitment to respecting human rights is anchored in the Code of Conduct, \nwith a special focus on the prevention of child labor, modern slavery, and human trafficking abuses. To ensure employees \nhave a comprehensive understanding of the Code of Conduct and their responsibilities arising from it, there is mandatory \ntraining. In 2024, the completion rate was 100% (2023: 100%). \nDeutsche Bank aims to provide a working environment free from harassment, discrimination, and retaliation, and where \nHuman Rights are safeguarded at any time. Anything less would prevent the bank from thriving, deepening stakeholders’ \ntrust and safeguarding its reputation. In the majority of circumstances, the bank's employees act with integrity and exhibit \nthe right behaviors, fully in line with the bank’s policies and procedures, as outlined in the “Workforce management” sub-\nchapter of the “Own workforce” chapter.  \nOn rare occasions conduct falls below the required standards. Deutsche Bank has established mechanisms to raise such \nmatters, like the whistleblowing channel and the complaints management channel as described in the chapter “Culture, \nintegrity and conduct”. Employee and non-employee complaints are handled in accordance with local laws. Additionally, \nthe bank deploys internal controls and processes to detect if something is not quite right and where appropriate it will \nfollow up with an investigation. Depending on the circumstances and the severity, it may be necessary to act, including \ndisciplinary action for employees.  \nThe bank strives to make disciplinary decisions in a consistent and transparent way. Every employee should feel they are \ntreated fairly. Deutsche Bank sees strong links between the expected behavior of its employees, how compensation is \ndetermined to account for risk and behavior, and disciplinary action for employees who fall short of the bank’s expectations \nabout conduct.  \n \n \n"}

This message \nhas been reinforced and is anchored in: \n– The new purpose statement Deutsche Bank launched during 2024 as part of its “This is Deutsche Bank” program: \n“Dedicated to our clients’ lasting success and financial security at home and abroad” \n– The vision: “The Global Hausbank: the European Champion and first choice for our clients around the world” \n– The strategy: “A sharpened business model, focusing on where we have leading market positions across our four client-\ncentric businesses” \nIn addition, Client centricity is articulated in Deutsche Bank’s Code of Conduct in the pillar “Our clients” as well as under \nthe critical behavior “Striving for excellent client experience” which encompasses among others learning about clients and \nunderstanding their needs, actively seeking out and adapting to client feedback.  \nAcknowledging that Deutsche Bank services different types of clients, all client related activities are aligned to the bank’s \nbusiness divisions. As of December 31, 2024, these were the following four: Corporate Bank, Investment Bank, Private Bank \nand Asset Management. Corporate Bank addresses the broad needs of a diverse set of corporate clients, financial \ninstitutions, investors and issuers in three client segments, being Corporate Treasury Services, Institutional Client Services \nand in Germany Business Banking. Investment Bank has a comprehensive global offering, providing institutional and \ncorporate clients with fixed income and currencies risk management and liquidity provision, leading financing capabilities \nand a full suite of origination and advisory services. Private Bank is the partner for all questions on financing and investment \nfor private clients in Germany and provides affluent clients and family entrepreneurs all over the world with tailor-made \ninvestment solutions. Asset Management offers a range of active, passive and alternative products that allow investors to \nposition themselves for any market scenario. In addition, the bank has a country and regional organizational layer.  \nAs part of Deutsche Bank’s double materiality assessment, the sub-topic of information related impacts for consumers and \nend-users stemming from ESRS S4 has been assessed as material. Information related impacts in relation to the bank’s \nproducts and services include access to quality information, freedom of expression and privacy and are connected to the \nbank’s ambition to strive for excellent client experience for existing and new customers, i.e., maintaining and expanding \nclient relationships over the short-, medium and long-term. The topic of data privacy, which is not only linked to clients \nand is also linked to the bank’s own workforce, is covered in the separate sub-chapter “Data protection” within the chapter \n“Governance Information” of the Sustainability Statement. The bank acknowledges that the terminology of “consumers \nand end-users” referred to under ESRS S4, when transposing it to the context of a financial institution, may only directly \nbe linked to private individuals in its Private Bank business. However, the bank’s ambition to clients, as outlined above, does \ninclude all types of clients within all its four business segments. Thus, for the Corporate Bank, Investment Bank and Asset \nManagement a broader understanding of clients has been applied reflecting the respective client structure of each \nbusiness (e.g., Corporate Bank serving corporate and institutional clients instead of private individuals). While entity-\nspecific disclosure requirements from ESRS 2 were applied to these three businesses being Corporate Bank, Investment \nBank and Asset Management the business specific disclosures to be found under the following sub-chapters of “Client \nsatisfaction” and “Complaint management” within this chapter „Client centricity”, were also guided by close orientation \non ESRS S4 disclosure requirements to create a comprehensive and comparable view on Client centricity across all four \nDeutsche Bank businesses.  \nBeing applied to Deutsche Bank, the topic of client centricity builds the frame for several elements along a holistic client \nlifecycle. Starting from ensuring that the bank complies with laws and regulations relating to the provision of financial \nproducts and services, which is covered under the sub-headings of Product responsibility in the following and ranging to \ncontinuously capturing client feedback and orientating its actions toward clients’ needs and expectations, which is \ndetailed under the subheadings of Client satisfaction and Complaint management in this chapter.  \nGovernance \nESRS 2 GOV-2 \nDeutsche Bank has distinct governance structures in place for the topics contributing to its client centricity ambitions.  \nProduct responsibility \nDeutsche Bank’s commitment to product responsibility is underpinned by its Code of Conduct which is approved by the \nbank’s Chief Compliance and Anti-Financial Crime Officer who is a member of the Management Board and applies to all \nemployees and members of the bank’s Management Board. Furthermore, the bank has a governance in place designed to \nreview and communicate policy requirements as required inclusive an accompanying extensive policy framework.  \n"}

The program focuses on three primary objectives: driving closer bank-wide \ncollaboration around clients, aligning client data and tooling across Deutsche Bank and improving client resource \nallocation to drive Shareholder Value Added (SVA). The program aims at revenue and market share increases across key \nclients with a view to increase the bank’s client penetration and product density. Key enablers include increased \nManagement Board sponsorship, established governance, cross-divisional collaboration supported by clear action plans \nand an enhanced incentive framework. By improving client penetration and product density, Deutsche Bank aims to \nsystematically bring its full capability and product expertise to its clients. The outcome is to continuously improve the \nunderstanding of client needs and better service clients through the entire client lifecycle (onboarding, KYC, operations \nand settlement. Enhanced tooling available to Deutsche Bank coverage employees is critical to ensure timely availability \nof client data, market trends and related activities, leveraging a range of different technologies, including AI (Artificial \nIntelligence). Significant progress has been achieved in 2024, including the identification of priority clients common across \nPrivate, Corporate and Investment Bank divisions and the definition of a desired state for client systems has been agreed, \ntailored by client type (relationship vs. mass market). A variety of information (internal client data, client feedback, external \ndata including share of wallet and client feedback) has been used to set goals in line with each division’s strengths and \nstrategic objectives, which will continue through 2025 and beyond.  \nDetailed strategic efforts are split across the separate topics Product responsibility, Client satisfaction and Complaint \nmanagement ultimately contributing to Deutsche Bank’s Client centricity ambitions.  \nProduct responsibility \nIt is when the bank delivers its products and services with integrity that trusting relationships with clients are developed, \nand sustainable performance is achieved. In practice, this means the bank’s products and services are designed with input \nfrom various control functions, checking that they are appropriate for the relevant market and align with the bank’s \nobjectives and values. Deutsche Bank seeks to adhere to relevant rules and regulations and endeavors to be fair, clear, and \naccurate when marketing its products and services.  \nClient satisfaction  \nSatisfied and loyal clients are vital for sustainable growth and the bank’s ongoing success. That is why gathering client \nfeedback systematically is an important aspect of Deutsche Bank’s Client centricity ambitions. Each of the bank’s business \ndivisions assesses client satisfaction in ways that make sense for its specific client groups. While there are no specific \nquantitative goals set, every business division uses customized metrics in alignment to their respective client groups, to \nmonitor current client-related developments, track progress of associated initiatives and implement improvements where \nneeded.  \nComplaint management  \nAs a matter of principle, Deutsche Bank strives to prevent complaints from arising by maintaining a robust new product \napproval process to ensure all products and services meet high quality standards. Further, identified weaknesses are \nreported to product owners and service responsible to decide on remediation measures to be taken in case of justified \ncomplaints. In any case, Deutsche Bank seeks to contact complainants (clients and non-clients) and reach a solution in due \ncourse. Complainants can address their complaints to any local branch, by email, online, or phone. Deutsche Bank strives \nto confirm receipt of complaints as soon as possible and to work on resolving them quickly and transparently. Furthermore, \nDeutsche Bank continuously monitors complaints to detect emerging trends and to identify the root causes. Additionally, \nDeutsche Bank screens its complaints for reoccurring issues. \n"}

For example, the Business Selection and Conflicts Office which is part of the Compliance & Anti-Financial Crime \nfunction is responsible primarily for managing transaction-related conflicts and reports to the Management Board at least \nonce a year. In addition, the bank’s Employee Compliance Program is designed to check whether employees’ personal \ntransactions are conducted in line with regulatory requirements and are not harmful to clients or the market. Further, the \nbank’s Compliance Control Room team support the management of conflicts by recording the flow of inside information \nand insiders.  \nProcesses on complaint management \nIf a client expresses dissatisfaction with a product or service, the bank has procedures in place to resolve the situation \nequitably, which may include, where relevant, notifying regulators through the provision of individual complaint details, \naggregate complaint data or otherwise. The complaint process varies by Deutsche Bank business division. Further \ninformation can be found in the subsequent Complaint Management chapters.  \nThe bank may be subject to litigation in instances where clients believe they have been sold an unsuitable or inappropriate \nproduct or service, they have been inappropriately advised or there has been a conflict of interest, and these grievances \ncannot otherwise be resolved.

CSTs \nare informed by internal and external data to assess the performance and satisfaction in the respective client relationship \non a regular basis. Senior management supports CSTs in managing these relationships and adds an additional feedback \nchannel available to clients.  \nIn addition, in the Corporate Bank, service and implementation teams for the Corporate Cash Management (CCM) business \nline ask clients since 2018 for structured feedback on their service experience. More than 1,500 clients responded to the \nCCM survey in 2024, providing feedback on the individual client service experience and informing the client service and \nproduct strategy of CCM. In 2024, the business line Trade Finance & Lending and German Mid-Corp Client Services were \nadded to the survey-scope. \nCorporate Bank recognizes the importance of client feedback and in case of a client complaint, follows the requirements \nand steps laid out in the key operating document “Complaints Handling, Reporting and Controls KOD – Corporate Bank \nGlobal”. \nInvestment Bank \nThe Investment Bank utilizes a variety of information (internal client data, direct client feedback, external data including \nshare of wallet and client feedback on DB) to assess a range of metrics relating to its performance with clients. This \ninformation forms the basis upon which the Investment Bank selects priority clients and sets target in line with its strategic \nmarket ranking ambitions. These are then monitored on a regular basis and provide insights, such as strength and health \nof the relationship with specific clients or groups thereof. The data also enables analysis of wider market and client trends, \nwhich feeds into the overall divisional strategy.

In addition, client feedback can be received during bilateral client meetings. This information is \nthen shared across the relevant Management and Coverage team to incorporate the feedback with the objective of \ncontinuous improvement of client servicing.  \nAs previously mentioned in the Corporate Bank’s Client Satisfaction section, the Investment Bank also applies the Client \nService Team (CST) framework for its clients. \nThe Investment Bank recognizes the importance of client feedback and in case of a client complaint, follows the \nrequirements and steps laid out in the Client Complaints Handling Key Operating Document – IB Global & CRU which is \nfurther detailed in the following sub-chapter on Complaint management.  \nPrivate Bank \nWithin Private Bank, client satisfaction is measured primarily based on the Net Promoter Score (NPS). The NPS measures \nthe willingness of customers to recommend a company on a scale of 0 – 10 and asks for their reasons why. NPS scores can \nrange from -100 to +100 and customer responses fall into three categories: Promoters, Passives and Detractors.  \nThe Private Bank reports NPS regularly to senior, regional and branch management. The NPS process within the Private \nBank is coordinated globally, but actioned within each region to ensure the surveys address local business needs. \nPrivate Bank provides clients with a range of contact methods, including directly via its branch network, digital and phone. \nThe Private Bank digital channels provide self-service tools, as well as details for clients to contact the Bank via e-mail, \nforms, call center or local office/branch information. For instance, in Germany, Italy and Spain there are dedicated \ndebit/credit card assistance phone numbers and in Belgium there is a ‘victims of fraud’ phone number to assist clients in \nneed. \nPrivate Bank in Germany  \nIn Germany, Private Bank offers services across all client sectors (Personal Banking, Private Banking/Wealth Management) \nlargely via two core brands Deutsche Bank and Postbank. \nWithin the Deutsche Bank brand, NPS was introduced in 2022 in a phased approach. Since 2023 all branches, regional \nadvisory centers, call centers, online product purchases and selected digital service interactions, are connected to the NPS \nsystem, to gain an understanding of customer perspectives. For example, clients are contacted for feedback immediately \nafter a range of interactions including an in-person branch visit, using selected online services, a product purchase or after \na conversation with a call center.  \nThe NPS survey process in Private Bank in Germany ensures that the relevant client advisor receives NPS feedback \npromptly and can respond to customer feedback in a timely manner. This is particularly important in situations where there \nhas been negative feedback and allows for quick remediation. \nFor Deutsche Bank brand, the NPS improved to 67 (FY 2023: 63) based on a client interacting with the sales channels. In \n2024, more than 165,000 clients gave their feedback: 76% of the customers surveyed are “Promoters” who would \nrecommend Deutsche Bank. \nFor the Postbank brand, the NPS roll-out was fully completed mid 2024 (post the Project “Unity” IT data migration) and as \nof December 2024 the NPS stands at 13 based on a client interaction with the sales channels. Available sales channel data \nfor 2024 indicates that Postbank showed improvements in NPS results through the year.

Different regional parameters were used in 2024 calculations making 2023 regional-\nweighted comparisons invalid.  \nAsset Management \nDWS refers to institutional investors and intermediaries as clients, also for the purpose of this report. The terms “end-users” \nand “consumers” relate to retail investors, which are indirect clients, serviced through intermediaries and institutional \ninvestors. Those retail clients are investors in mutual funds and ETF products, therefore not in scope of this report.  \nTo measure client satisfaction globally in a consistent way, a new client satisfaction survey with the top 50 global clients, \nincluding strategic distribution partners, was published as a pilot project in 2022 using the net promoter score \nmethodology. The survey aims to enhance client experience and to further strengthen client centric orientation. The net \npromoter score rates the likelihood of recommending DWS to a business contact and ranges from minus 100 to plus 100. \nIn 2024, DWS conducted the third annual survey with around 170 top clients being covered. The 2024 score was 53 \n(compared to 50 in 2023) across all clients.  \nDWS strives to process findings from client satisfaction surveys and complaints quickly to implement them accordingly. \nSenior management regularly reviews interim results and compares internal scores against the industry benchmark. All \nresults are communicated to relevant internal stakeholders, including senior management, service center staff, and the \nworkers' council. Based on the feedback, DWS formulates steps for improvement which are incorporated into employee \ntraining.  \nTo determine development year over year, DWS aims to repeat the satisfaction surveys for the same population again next \nyear.  \nComplaint management \nESRS 2 MDR-P, ESRS 2 MDR-M, ESRS 2 MDR-A, ESRS S4-1, ESRS S4-2, ESRS S4-3, ESRS S4-4 \nDeutsche Bank has established global processes for dealing with customer complaints. They are delineated in the Client \nComplaints Policy and detailed in the Client Complaints Procedure. The policy and procedure are supplemented by unit \nspecific key operating documents, which provide for the implementation of all policy and procedure requirements in the \nunits. All these documents are made available on the Deutsche Bank Policy Portal, which is accessible to all employees of \nthe bank. Moreover, the policy and procedure comply with the “Guidelines for complaints-handling for the securities \n(European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA) and banking (European Banking Authority, EBA) sectors,” as jointly \nissued by the ESMA and the EBA and with their interpretation by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority \n(Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin). The policy and procedure set global minimum standards for \nhandling complaints and to ensure that all locations, branches, and subsidiaries handle and resolve complaints impartially \nand without undue delay. They apply to all corporate divisions and supporting infrastructure functions (together units). All \nunits are responsible for implementing the policy and the procedure respectively. The policy and procedure define which \ncomplaints are in scope or out of scope and set requirements for the recording, internal and external reporting, escalation \nof increased risk complaints, while determining roles and responsibilities. Local requirements are provided for in a country \nannex to the policy. Out of scope are concerns raised by employees without nexus to the securities and banking business \nof Deutsche Bank as well as concern raised by vendors, brokers, intermediaries or Deutsche Bank Group companies \nreceiving services from the bank. As complaints are handled by the complaint management functions within the units, \neach unit head is responsible for the implementation of the policy and procedure requirements and therefore appoints a \nglobal head of complaint management responsible for the oversight and day-to-day handling of client complaints. \nPursuant to the local regulatory requirements, in Spain, the complaint management function lies with the Compliance \nfunction where the responsible head of the complaint management function is the local Head of Compliance. \n \n \n"}

The effectiveness of the \nprocess is demonstrated by monitoring the closure of complaints, the average handling time as well as the aggregation of \nredress payments to clients. Metrics on client complaints are included in divisional reports to their senior management and \nthe Management Board. Therefore, the bank uses changes in the number of raised and closed complaints, as well as the \nchanges in average handling time and paid redress over two consecutive quarters to evaluate performance and \neffectiveness of the handling of complaints within the bank globally. A change of ten percent or more is being evaluated \nqualitatively and analyzed by the business divisions. Such processes support the remediation of identified negative impacts \nthat may have arisen. \nNot only can products and services be subject to a complaint but also the complaint management process itself. Therefore, \ncomplainants are free to complain about the complaint management function. Hereby, the satisfaction with the complaint \nmanagement process can be evaluated.  \nCorporate Bank  \nCorporate Bank's process for handling of complaints is laid out in the key operating document (KOD) “Complaints \nHandling, Reporting and Controls KOD – Corporate Bank Global”, which is owned by the Divisional Control Office as a \nhorizontal function across the Corporate Bank. This process follows the governance framework stipulated by Compliance \nas the second line policy-owning function. The KOD is updated at least annually. \nTypically, complaints are received by a client service officer who logs the complaint utilizing a template that ensures \nmandatory capturing of key attributes of the complaint, as defined in the KOD. If the officers cannot handle the complaint \nthemselves, involving other product or technical experts as required, they identify an appropriate complaint owner who \nwill manage resolution of the complaint or escalate to management or other departments of the bank, as necessary. \nComplaints are categorized depending on the severity of the impact on the client or the bank with reference to the bank’s \nstandard Non-Financial Risk Rating Grid. The aging of complaints is tracked, which may trigger escalation if the number of \ndays, for which the complaint has been open, is unreasonable or according to timelines stipulated in regulations, such as \nthe EU’s Payment Service Directive. On a monthly basis, complaints data are reviewed by business coordinators residing in \neach Corporate Bank sub-business area for adherence to quality standards. These coordinators submit the data to a central \ncomplaints function that performs a further quality control review and analyses the data for trends relating to products, \nroot causes, ageing, business areas, locations etc. Oversight of the Corporate Bank complaints framework is performed by \nthe monthly Complaints Oversight Forum which reviews the monthly complaints data across the Corporate Bank globally. \nThe forum reviews the trend analysis, challenges business areas on specific complaints and is an onward escalation path \nto Compliance and the Corporate Bank’s Non-Financial Risk Council. Following an in-depth review, the framework was \nsimplified in the third quarter 2024 to put more attention on complaints displaying a higher level of potential risk to the \nCorporate Bank or to the client, as well as complaints that have been escalated. The intention is to streamline reporting \nand analysis of complaints, and to allow for greater oversight of these higher risk complaints. \nAs with previous years, there is a concentration of complaints for the Corporate Bank received by Business Banking in \nGermany owing to its large client base amongst small and medium-sized corporates. The volume of complaints decreased \nin 2024 by 8% compared to 2023, which had experienced a higher than usual level of complaints because of the migration \nproject of former Postbank clients to the Deutsche Bank infrastructure in 2023. The top root cause categories of \ncomplaints across Corporate Bank are operational issues, client communication issues, and application issues. \nInvestment Bank \nInvestment Bank’s process and requirements for handling of complaints are brought out in Client Complaints Policy, Client \nComplaints Procedure and Client Complaints Handling Key Operating Document – IB Global & CRU. This Key Operating \nDocument is owned by the Divisional Control Office as a horizontal function across the Investment Bank. The Document \nprovides the overall Investment Bank’s complaint reporting workflow and includes the responsibilities of the Complaint \nOwner, Business Coordinators and Central Complaints Management Team. Any employees in receipt of a complaint \n(whether received orally, in writing, online or by other means) must either take ownership as the Complaint Owner or notify \nan appropriate Complaint Owner of the complaint as soon as practically possible. The requirements for Complaint Owners, \nincluding mandatory data for logging complaints, has been brought out in the Client Complaints Procedure document. All \ncomplaints received and handled by Investment Bank are captured in the Investment Bank Client Complaints Capturing \nTemplate. Relevant complaint information including resolution communication, which is the responsibility of Complaint \nOwners to provide a final response to the Complainant, needs to be recorded and archived in a durable medium.  \n \n \n"}

Continued focus is on escalation \nto relevant 2nd Lines of Defense to ensure complaints are resolved with input from all stakeholders and in particular \nanything relating to alleged misconduct is properly investigated and escalated in accordance with the bank’s regulatory \nreporting obligations.  \nIn 2024, there was an increase of 56% YoY of complaint logging by Investment Bank compared to 2023, driven primarily \nby improved business reach and appointment of additional Business Coordinators, additional trainings for Business \nCoordinators and checks against surveillance alerts. The most common root cause of complaints continues to be \noperational issues, but complaints were also recorded relating to trade execution and pricing fees. \nPrivate Bank \nPrivate Bank operates globally, navigating diverse regulatory and legal frameworks regarding client complaint procedures. \nTo ensure compliance with both Deutsche Bank global client complaint framework and local regulatory requirements, \nwhile upholding high client service standards, the bank has implemented dedicated complaint management functions in \nevery operational region. These functions are supported by documented policies ensuring adherence to local regulatory \nrequirements. \nClients can submit complaints to the Private Bank directly (in person, by email, phone, etc.) or to a local or national \nombudsman or other regulatory body, as permitted by law. In each location the complaint is logged in a digital register \nand assigned to a complaint owner who investigates the issue thoroughly and responds to the client within a reasonable \ntimeframe, as determined by local regulations. \nAll complaints are handled with confidentiality and in compliance with respect for privacy and data protection rights. In \naddition, where necessary, immediate action is taken to minimize negative material impacts on clients, such as blocking \npotentially fraudulent transactions. Complaints Management Functions will also involve 2nd line of defense function such \nas Compliance, Anti-Financial Crime, Legal as subject matters experts when required to ensure a quick and efficient \nresolution of the client matter.  \nClient complaints trend and root cause analyses are regularly reviewed by local, regional, and global senior management. \nAny issues that pose a direct or potential significant risk to clients are promptly escalated to the appropriate regional or \nglobal senior management and relevant stakeholders. This ensures that appropriate remedial actions are identified and \nimplemented to mitigate any negative impact on clients. In addition, product-related client complaints are reviewed \nregularly through the Global Product Risk Oversight Group and in regional Risk Management Forums of Private Bank’s \nBanking, Lending, and Investment Solutions Trading Desks. Furthermore, product-related client complaints (as specific \ninformation/trigger) are provided for consideration within the Systematic Product Review, which reviews periodically if \nproducts are still fit for purpose. \nClient complaints at Private Bank decreased in 2024 by 18% versus 2023. \nInflow of new complaints in Personal Banking Germany decreased by 23% in 2024 compared to prior year with decreasing \nimpact on the complaint portfolio concerning complaints related to Postbank’s IT migration over the year. The \ncomprehensive remediation activities supported by increased staffing levels have continued and focused in particular on \nthe area of mortgage lending. Meanwhile client complaints are handled within planned service levels.  \nIn Wealth Management Germany the majority of complaints concerned the category “execution/settlement” and followed \nby concerns in the category “service”. Client complaints increased slightly year-on-year in 2024 compared to 2023. Overall, \nthere were no patterns or systematic focal points. \nSpain registered a 120% increase in new client complaint inflows in 2024, related primarily to claims for repayment of \nmortgage fees. This increase stemmed from a Spanish Supreme Court ruling declaring certain fees invalid, impacting the \nentire banking sector and the consequent heavy influx adversely affected complaint handling time. Remediation measures \nincluding increased staffing and technological enhancements were implemented throughout 2024, which successfully \nmitigated the backlog. As of November 2024, complaint handling times returned to standard service levels. \nItaly registered a 6% increase in client complaints compared to the previous year. This uptick is mainly attributed to a Know \nYour Client (KYC) remediation program necessitating clients to provide additional documentation. Failure to submit the \nrequired documentation within the stipulated timeframe resulted in temporary account restrictions, leading to an increase \nin complaints.  \n \n \n"}

These classification elements form part of the \nrespective reports to DWS management and Compliance.  \nThe DWS Group Complaints Policy, owned by DWS Compliance, sets out the globally applicable minimum standards for \ncomplaint handling across DWS Group, designed to provide impartial and consistent handling and resolution of complaints \nwithout undue delay in all locations, branches and subsidiaries or affiliates. Through the implementation of the policy, the \nGerman securities trading act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz (WpHG)) is reflected. All Heads of Business Units must establish \nan appropriate framework for handling complaints meeting the minimum standards including the establishment of a \ndedicated complaints management function, which is responsible for putting in place an appropriate framework for \ncomplaints handling and management.  \nClient-facing Business Units maintain Key Operating Documents (KOD), which refer to the Group’s minimum requirements \nfor handling and reporting complaints and specify the complaint handling routines in their daily activities. Senior Managers \nare required to ensure adherence to the procedures and control processes documented therein.  \nSupervisors attest in line with the DWS Global Supervision Framework and Written Supervisory Procedures (WSP) that all \nreceived complaints have been handled, logged, investigated, solved and reported in accordance with minimum standards \nand regulatory requirements.

Whilst \nthose risks have been assessed as likely to materialize on a medium-term basis, the bank is mitigating them through its \ncontinuous work and actions driving its aspirational culture as further described in the following sections.  \nRaise a Concern Framework, Whistleblowing and Speak Up \nA key component supporting the bank’s aspirational culture is the Raise a Concern framework which is governed by the \nRaising Concerns (including Whistleblowing) Policy, a Compliance-owned global group-wide policy approved by the \nGroup Chief Compliance Officer. The policy, which is available on the policy portal and reviewed at a minimum annually, \nsets out the bank’s internal approach for raising concerns. It actively encourages employees to report possible violations \nof laws, rules, regulations, bank policies and conflicts of interest and it requires employees to raise concerns about possible \ncriminal activity by the bank, its employees, clients or third parties. Employees may do so by reaching out to the \nWhistleblowing Central Function, a ringfenced team within the bank’s Anti-Financial Crime function specialized in \nconcerns related to potential misconduct by Deutsche Bank Group, those who work for Deutsche Bank Group, or any other \nentity or individual acting on behalf of Deutsche Bank Group. All reports are taken seriously and managed sensitively and \nconfidentially. Quarterly reporting on trends and themes including substantiation rates and fact patterns is provided to \nsenior management as well as to the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee. In addition, the chair of the Supervisory Board’s \nAudit Committee is informed of highest risk rating concerns via ad hoc notifications pursuant to a defined escalation \nprocedure.  \nWith a focus on trust, the bank built upon the Speak-Up activities and expanded their reach and scope beyond raising \nconcerns to empowerment and purpose with focus on Speak-Up as the right thing to do. This Speak-Up message supports \nthe bank’s supervision culture, the bank’s aspirational culture and supports the continued evolution of the Culture, \nIntegrity and Conduct agenda. All new managers are automatically enrolled in the virtual mandatory course on Speak-Up \nand Listen Up, Your Supervisory Duties as a Manage, with an annual refresh cycle for all managers. To bolster and embed \nfurther Speak-Up content is included in mandatory courses such as Code of Conduct for all staff every 18 to 24 months \nand Risk Awareness for all staff bi-annually. In 2024 the completion rates were 99.98% (Code of Conduct), 100% (Your \nSupervisory Duties as a Manager) and 99.99% (Risk Awareness). \nEmployees are encouraged to speak-up directly to their management, representatives of Control Functions or Human \nResources which includes the employment matter related grievance processes as described in sub-chapter “Processes to \nremediate negative impacts and channels for own workforce to raise concerns” of the “Own workforce” chapter within the \nSustainability Statement. However, where they do not feel comfortable using these avenues, the Whistleblowing \nframework is in place. Where permissible under local law, employees can also raise concerns anonymously via the Integrity \nHotline, a special electronic platform and a telephone reporting system, with anonymity protected to the fullest extent \npossible. \nThe Whistleblowing Central Function has dedicated personnel in Frankfurt and London and can be contacted directly, by \nemail or by raising a report via the Integrity hotline. In addition, the Whistleblowing Central Function runs Exit and New \nJoiner Surveys as additional escalation channels to proactively identify potential areas of concern. The surveys include a \nseries of questions relating to Speak-Up culture awareness and raising concerns. Respondents who identified that they \nhad a concern which they did not raise are provided with the opportunity to provide contact details for confidential follow-\nup by the Whistleblowing Central Function.

Its aim is to foster an \nenvironment that is open and diverse, where staff opinions and speaking up are valued and where employees’ and the \nbank’s success is built on respect, collaboration and teamwork in serving clients, stakeholders and communities. The \nManagement Board is accountable for the implementation of the Code of Conduct, with review activities and update \nprocesses overseen by the Culture, Integrity and Conduct Committee. In 2024 the Code of Conduct was reviewed and \nupdated to align with This is Deutsche Bank, setting out the bank’s standards of behavior and conduct, to which all \nemployees are expected to adhere. \nThe Code of Conduct covers the impact on stakeholders and society at large by providing an overview of the processes \nfostering the possibility to speak up, raise concerns and Whistleblowing. It further provides guidance on doing the right \nthing, valuing employees and building trust in the workplace, thoughtful decision making, personal and client related \nactivities, conflicts of interest, financial crime prevention and detection, sustainability and respecting human rights, fair \nand free markets, with respective scenarios and links to underlying policies and procedures. With this, the Code mitigates \nthe risk of reputational damage, increased (legal) costs and loss of clients due to inappropriate business conduct, improper \nmanagement of conflict of interest and fiduciary duties, bias and negligence. The Code of Conduct is reviewed annually \nand updated when required. The annual review cycle is supported through working groups which include stakeholders \nacross all divisions and infrastructure functions as well as Risk Type Controllers for the respective areas, to allow for all \nstakeholders to assess relevance, accuracy and completeness of their contributions to the code. The Code is published on \nDeutsche Bank’s external website and on its internal Policy Portal.  \nThe Supplier Code of Conduct raises awareness of the standards of behavior that Deutsche Bank expects of its suppliers. \nFor further information on the Supplier Code of Conduct please refer to chapter “Supply Chain Management” within the \nSustainability Statement. \n \n \n"}

Organized crime engages in fraud, bribery, corruption, terrorist financing, and money \nlaundering. Criminals use complex money laundering schemes, including targeted placement and layering across different \nborders, in their attempts to integrate the proceeds of their crimes back into the global financial system. External actors \nseek to abuse the financial system to evade sanctions and embargoes. In addition, there is a persistent risk of terrorist \norganizations trying to abuse the financial system to finance or facilitate their activities. Deutsche Bank also fights the risk \nof internal fraud by employees as well as the facilitation of tax evasion. \nFighting financial crime is an integral part of Deutsche Bank’s business activities, and continuous improvements to the \nGroup’s capabilities in fighting financial crime are a critical priority. Successfully fighting financial crime not only mitigates \nthe negative impacts and risks but also generates positive impacts on society and business opportunities. Effective anti-\nfinancial crime controls are critical components of Deutsche Bank’s strategy. This includes in-depth knowledge about \nDeutsche Bank’s clients, their source of funds, their source of wealth, their true tax residencies, and their ultimate beneficial \nowners. The Management Board and all employees are required to adhere to the highest standards of conduct to fight \nfinancial crime.  \nGovernance \nESRS 2 GOV-2 \nEvery employee at Deutsche Bank is responsible for managing financial crime risk. These responsibilities and obligations \ninclude (i) the prevention of financial crime by knowing clients, reviewing potential clients, running preventative controls, \nand observing obligations and policies, (ii) the detection of unusual or suspicious behavior or patterns, including the use of \nalerts from transaction monitoring systems that are reviewed by dedicated and trained teams, and (iii) the reporting of \nclients, third parties and/or transactions that appear suspicious or unusual.  \nThe ultimate decision and authority regarding the assessment, management and acceptance of financial crime risks lies \nwith the Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer, who also heads the Anti-Financial Crime function and reports to the \nCompliance and Anti-Financial Crime Management Board member. This Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer is a \ndelegated authority from the Management Board, authorized to establish a Financial Crime Risk Management framework \nand take necessary measures to manage risks in compliance with legal requirements. The Officer’s role is guided by the by \nGerman Money Laundering Act (Geldwäschegesetz), the Directive on Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing \n(AMLD IV) and EBA guidelines. The Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank is regularly informed about the status of financial \ncrime risk management by the Management Board and the Group Anti-Money Laundering Officer, for example, with \nquarterly updates to the Supervisory Board’s Audit Committee. \nThe Anti-Financial Crime function acts independently and sets policies and standards, while Deutsche Bank’s business \ndivisions are responsible and accountable for their implementation and operationalization. The Management Board \nensures that the Anti-Financial Crime function can execute its tasks independently and effectively.  \nStrategy \nESRS 2 SBM-3 \nDeutsche Bank is committed to protecting its clients, society, and its own assets by taking an active role in the prevention, \ndetection, and reporting of financial crime. Recognizing the material threats posed by financial crime, the Anti-Financial \nCrime function has defined a uniform strategy across financial crime risk prevention, detection, and reporting to ensure \nthe highest level of protection for Deutsche Bank’s clients and stakeholders, while also supporting sustainable business \npractices. The Anti-Financial Crime strategy focuses on remediation, simplification, and consolidation of processes, and \nevolving the AFC Program across the areas of risk appetite, risk assessment, policy, training, assurance and reporting. The \nstrategy serves to accelerate decision-making around financial crime risks, enforce consistent standards, and foster \ncollaboration with business divisions and regions, ensuring that Deutsche Bank operates within its risk appetite and that \nthere is a clear culture of risk ownership and accountability.  \n \n \n"}

Deutsche Bank is committed to continually enhancing its financial \ncrime control environment and leveraging technology and analytics to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency, and \nsustainability of its financial crime controls. This is made possible by working collaboratively across all lines of defense, as \nwell as being an active partner in the anti-financial crime community and working closely with law enforcement, regulators, \nand the private sector to prevent, detect and report financial crime.  \nAs an international financial institution offering a diversified range of global banking products, Deutsche Bank understands \nits responsibility to support the industry’s anti-financial crime agenda. Failing to have effective controls around money \nlaundering, terrorist financing, corruption, bribery, fraud, modern slavery, or the facilitation of tax evasion, e.g., by \nfacilitating clients to exploit jurisdictional differences in tax laws, and failing to prevent criminals from exploiting Deutsche \nBank’s products and services, can have serious and immediate effects on society. These include undermining the rule of \nlaw and social justice, weakening public services, lowering tax revenues by underpayment of tax, sanctions, the loss of \nbanking services, and financial instability, often impacting the most vulnerable members of society. Deutsche Bank \nregularly and at least annually performs an assessment of its exposure to financial crime risks, giving consideration to its \nentities’ and branches’ business activities, clients, products and services, transactions, delivery channels, and geographical \nlocations, and applies strict due diligence to all lending and investment activities. \nCompliance and Anti-Financial Crime fosters a strong risk culture through collaboration across all lines of defense and \nwith the public and private sectors. The Anti-Financial Crime team strives to embody a culture known for its dedication, \ncollaboration, and expertise. Deutsche Bank promotes a culture of compliance and integrity, with senior management \nplaying a crucial role in reinforcing this culture. There is an emphasis on encouraging employees to speak up, supported \nby extensive training and communication campaigns. The speak-up program and whistleblowing channel are detailed in \nthe \"Culture, integrity, and conduct\" chapter within this Sustainability Statement. \nImpact, risk and opportunity management \nESRS 2 MDR-P, ESRS 2 MDR-A  \nThe Anti-Financial Crime function is involved in structural changes, such as new products, new lines of business, \nexpansions, or new client categories to ensure they align with Deutsche Bank’s financial crime risk appetite and have \neffective controls, risk assessments, and monitoring before their launch. Anti-Financial Crime also monitors legal \nrequirements, translates them into policies, and supports business divisions in implementing them in relevant processes. \nThere are dedicated employees within AFC, the business divisions, and Technology who are dedicated to managing, or \ncontributing to the management of, financial crime risks. In 2022, the Anti-Financial Crime function initiated a hiring \nstrategy to strengthen execution and leadership capabilities, leading to a substantial increase of AFC’s headcount with \nover 500 employees added over the course of 2023 addressing requirements from remediation. In line with remediation \nprogress, the increase in employee number for AFC slowed down in 2024. The function reached 2,492 employees by year-\nend 2024, up from 2,397 employees in the previous year. Additionally, AFC was supported by approximately 900 \ncontingent workers. \nDeutsche Bank has identified the need to strengthen its internal control environment and infrastructure. Reviews by \nseveral regulators have led to requirements for Deutsche Bank to improve its anti-money laundering, sanctions, and other \ncontrols. Deutsche Bank continues to execute change initiatives to strengthen its anti-financial crime program in \naccordance with Deutsche Bank’s change governance framework, and with direct oversight by the Management Board. \nThroughout 2024, various initiatives have enhanced controls and processes across all aspects of the program, including \ngovernance, dynamic risk assessment, risk appetite setting, KYC controls, oversight of affiliates and subsidiaries, \ntransactional controls such as monitoring and filtering, and controls testing. The focus remains on ensuring these \nenhancements in sustainable, business-as-usual operations. \nThe United States has established a secondary sanctions regime whereby measures can be taken against foreign financial \ninstitutions engaged in transactions involving Russia’s military-industrial base. These sanctions could restrict access to the \nUnited States market, freeze assets, damage reputation, and cause loss of business. Deutsche Bank has enhanced existing \ncontrols to identify transactions and clients with higher secondary sanctions risk exposure but cannot eliminate the risk \nthat it might inadvertently facilitate transactions that could give rise to secondary sanctions. Deutsche Bank continuously \nenhances its controls and processes to comply with regulations, particularly across its affiliates, and regularly tracks and \ntests adherence and potential risks thereto.  \n \n \n"}

The Framework subsumes financial crime risks under money laundering, terrorist financing and facilitation of \ntax evasion, sanctions and embargoes, internal and external fraud and bribery and corruption. The document should be \nread in conjunction with the Code of Conduct, the Risk Management Policy, and the Risk Appetite framework. \nDeutsche Bank has a comprehensive set of policies that establish the minimum standards in line with all relevant regulatory \nrequirements across all jurisdictions where Deutsche Bank operates. Key policies are the Group’s Anti-Money Laundering \nPolicy which encompasses Anti-Money Laundering as well as the Prevention of the Facilitation of Tax Evasion and Counter \nTerrorist Financing, Sanctions Policy, Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy and Anti-Fraud Policy. The policies apply to all \nemployees and are reviewed annually with input from relevant stakeholders within Deutsche Bank as per the Policy on \nRequirements for Policies, Procedures, Key Operating and Framework Documents. The most recent versions of all policies \nare available on Deutsche Bank’s policy portal, and changes are communicated to all employees. Familiarity is reinforced \nthrough mandatory training, including links to the relevant policies and procedures, and failure to comply can lead to \ndisciplinary action. Where necessary, policy details are made available to stakeholders helping to implement minimum \nstandards laid out in the policies. The Management Board of Deutsche Bank is ultimately accountable for the \nimplementation of these policies. \nIn addition, Deutsche Bank adheres to standards from organizations such as the Wolfsberg Group on the prevention of \nMoney Laundering and Terrorist Financing \nPrevention of money laundering, terrorist financing, and facilitation of tax evasion \nMoney laundering, terrorist financing, and the facilitation of tax evasion pose significant risks to Deutsche Bank. To manage \nthese risks Deutsche Bank has established minimum control standards including risk-based client due diligence, \nmonitoring of transactions, name list screening, investigation of alerts, and filing of suspicious activity reports to \nauthorities. These suspicious activity reports can be triggered by alerts from transaction monitoring, internal referrals from \nemployees, enquiries of law enforcement, or referrals from other banks. Additional measures include assessing client risk \nexposure and reducing it by, for example, terminating relevant client relationships and liquidating or reducing risk in \nrelevant and associated positions.  \n \n \n"}

Deutsche Bank has policies, procedures and controls that cover those areas that present an increased risk of \nbribery and corruption, the cornerstone of which is the Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy. These policies cover all key \nareas of Deutsche Bank’s bribery and corruption risk exposure, including key risk areas such as gifts and entertainment, \ncharitable donations, hiring practices, joint ventures and strategic investments, vendor risk management, books and \nrecords, and political contributions. Bribery and corruption policies and procedures apply to all employees, including \ntemporary and contract employees. \nDeutsche Bank continues to reduce its exposure to areas that present a higher inherent bribery and corruption risk, such \nas the use of business development consultants, and continues to enhance its existing controls. In addition, Deutsche Bank \nhas implemented preventative and detective controls including increased levels of management approval, enhanced due \ndiligence on business development consultants and joint venture/strategic investment partners, including anti-bribery \ncontractual representations and warranties, and ongoing monitoring of employee behavior.  \nIdentified instances of bribery and corruption are independently investigated, with disciplinary actions for employees \nranging from Red Flags up to termination of employment. Identified instances would be reported to senior management \nand relevant legal or regulatory authorities.

The risk of anti-competitive behavior is inherent in Deutsche Bank’s operations and the \nscale and complexity of its daily activities and services provided. Deutsche Bank may be exposed to legal action and \nreputational damage if authorities or others were to take enforcement or other corrective action. Relevant products and \njurisdictions are typically highly regulated with significant regulatory scrutiny and frequent enforcement action in the \nindustry for non-compliance of applicable rules and regulations. \nDeutsche Bank has no tolerance for its employees to engage in breach of antitrust laws and regulations and is committed \nto compliance with antitrust laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Deutsche Bank’s most critical asset against \nantitrust risks are its employees. Deutsche Bank promotes a risk culture that encourages employees to speak-up and a \nthorough awareness of antitrust risks. Tone from the top is extremely important and senior management is highly \ncommitted to reinforce this culture of integrity. The wider speak-up program and the relating Whistleblowing channel is \ndescribed in the chapter “Culture, integrity and conduct”. \nPotential instances of antitrust are independently investigated and any employee determined to be engaged in such \nbehavior would be subject to disciplinary actions, including red flags, up to and including termination of employment. \nIdentified instances of antitrust breaches would be reported to senior management and relevant legal or regulatory \nauthorities. \n \n \n"}

Deutsche Bank operates \na control framework and governance structure, advocates for the development of sound internal processes and does not \nendorse actions that constitute violations of antitrust laws. The Non-Financial Risk Committee oversees, governs and \ncoordinates the management of the non-financial risks group wide, including antitrust. In addition, a senior governance \nforum, the antitrust operating forum, is dedicated to antitrust. It has representatives across different functions, including \nbusiness, infrastructure, antitrust experts and senior employees and has been integrated into the general structure of \nDeutsche Bank’s reporting lines, escalating into the Group Compliance Officer and the Group General Counsel with \nreporting and escalation lines into the Management Board. The antitrust operating forum currently meets every two \nmonths to monitor external key developments and trends in the area of anti-competitive behavior and be informed of \nrelevant key internal developments. \nDeutsche Bank has implemented the Antitrust Risk Management Framework Policy, which is the bank’s Antitrust Policy \nthat applies within Deutsche Bank and its affiliates to all employees globally and sets out the obligations on employees in \nrelation to antitrust risk. The Policy is to be read in conjunction with the Code of Conduct. It is reviewed annually, and \nrelevant changes are communicated to all employees. The most recent version of the Antitrust Policy is available on \nDeutsche Bank’s internal Policy Portal that is available on the intranet page and is accessible by all employees of Deutsche \nBank to minimize the negative effects of a potential breach. \nThe Antitrust Policy requires all employees to identify, report, and manage the risk appropriately, and it provides for \nrelevant escalation channels to report incidents in relation to anti-competitive behavior. The policy defines the \nmanifestations of the risk, how Deutsche Bank manages and mitigates the risk as part of its enterprise-wide risk \nmanagement framework. It observes various global antitrust rules and regulations and takes into account the \ninterpretation and enforcement practice of competition authorities. The policy covers key areas of antitrust, including \nforms of collusive behavior, information exchange with competitors, participation in trade associations and other external \ncommittees as well as other business gatherings, aspects related to human resources as well as joint venture activity and \nother forms of cooperation. The policy defines governance and sets out the requirements and minimum standards that \nrelevant divisions must meet, including implementing key controls related to identify, prevent or detect antitrust risk as \nrelevant. Senior Regional Business Management is responsible for developing policies and procedures to define, \nimplement and document processes and controls that meet the requirements of the Antitrust Policy and are accountable \nfor the implementation of the policies and the minimum standards.  \nDeutsche Bank has designed and implemented preventative and detective antitrust controls to manage antitrust risk, all \nof which are critical components of Deutsche Bank’s risk framework management strategy. Deutsche Bank undertakes a \nrisk and control assessment of inherent antitrust risks and corresponding controls across its businesses on an annual basis. \nAs a result, it continues to implement new and further enhance its existing controls in key risk areas. For example, these \ninclude controls around interaction with third parties, contract related, as well as monitoring interaction with third parties. \nThere have been no material changes since the annual risk and control assessment process in the previous year. The risk \nremains within tolerance as customized remediation actions including control enhancements, targeted training initiatives \nand policy updates were developed and further implemented. \nAntitrust training is essential to ensure compliance with antitrust laws, rules and regulations and to raise employees’ \nawareness to enable them to better identify and assess antitrust risks and escalate as necessary. Deutsche Bank has \nimplemented mandatory training for all staff on antitrust principles and applicable scenarios that have regulatory focus \nbased on their sub-divisions. The training encompasses the content of the Antitrust Policy, the key compliance \nrequirements and what steps must be taken to report potential breaches. The antitrust training is rolled out on a recurring \nbasis to all members of staff globally via Deutsche Bank’s online e-learning platform. The antitrust mandatory training is \nsupplemented by further antitrust training that is done ad hoc and tailored to specific business units. The mandatory \ntraining has been updated in 2024, refreshed with new scenarios, and re-launched to address anti-competitive behavior. \nIn 2024 the completion rates for the training was above 99.9%.  \nThe antitrust mandatory training is subject to the Red Flag process with objective measures to monitor and assess \nadherence to certain risk-related behaviors, policies, and procedures. Red Flags are considered in promotion, \ncompensation, and performance management decisions. For employees, failure to complete the mandatory training and \nlate completion can result in disciplinary consequences that can adversely affect employees’ compensation and their \nmanager’s.  \n"}

The bank’s tax affairs are managed by the in-house tax function, which is an independent risk and control \nfunction separate to the business divisions. The Global Head of Tax, who leads the in-house tax function, has a direct \nreporting line into the Chief Financial Officer. The tax function supports the Management Board in defining the tax \nstrategy, which is published externally, as well as the tax principles policy framework. Both the tax strategy as well as the \ntax principles policy framework are approved by the Chief Financial Officer and the Management Board.  \nStrategy \nESRS 2 SBM-3  \nThe key principles of the above referenced tax strategy and tax principles are: \n– Deutsche Bank undertakes its tax affairs on a basis which generates sustainable value while meeting applicable legal \nand regulatory tax requirements \n– Deutsche Bank gives due regard to the intent and spirit of tax laws, the social context within which the bank operates, \nand the bank’s standing and reputation with the public, tax administrations, regulators, and political representatives \nThese principles apply to all businesses, regions and entities. They enable the bank to manage the tax affairs in a way which \naims to ensure that the tax consequences of business operations are appropriately aligned with the economic, regulatory, \nand commercial consequences of those business operations, with due regard being given to the potential perspective of \nthe relevant tax authorities. \nTax evasion, which is a financial crime, is illegal and goes against Deutsche Bank’s culture and the bank’s policies strictly \nprohibit aiding or abetting tax evasion as further explained in the chapter “Anti-Financial Crime” within the Sustainability \nStatement. \nImpact, risk and opportunity management, metrics and targets \nESRS 2 IRO-2, ESRS 2 MDR-P, ESRS 2 MDR-A, GRI 207-4 \nIn conducting its business affairs, setting up and structuring its business operations and commercial activities, the bank \nconsiders the tax requirements of the respective jurisdictions in which it operates, with a view to generating sustainable \nvalue to Deutsche Bank and its shareholders. In this context the bank is subject to tax-related risks, which is an inherent \nconsequence of the scale and diversity of Deutsche Bank’s business activities and the international nature of the bank’s \nbusiness. This is exacerbated by the growing complexity of international tax laws and divergent approach of national tax \nauthorities in various instances. The bank seeks to understand and mitigate risks where possible. It operates a control \nframework which ensures that it is compliant in all material aspects with applicable tax laws, files accurate tax returns, and \npays the amount of tax due. In addition, the bank aims for its dealings with tax authorities to be undertaken in a proactive, \ntransparent, professional, courteous, and timely manner and seeks to develop and foster good working relationships with \ntax authorities. \nThe bank does not provide tax advice to clients. The tax principles embedded in the bank’s new product approval process \nstipulate that transactions with clients are to be conducted on the basis that clients comply with relevant tax laws and \nreporting requirements. The bank also expects the same from third parties providing services to the bank or on the bank’s \nbehalf (for further information see “Supply chain management” chapter within this Sustainability Statement).  \nThe bank’s in-house tax function manages the bank’s tax affairs consistent with the tax strategy and tax principles on a \nbasis which generates sustainable value and protects Deutsche Bank’s reputation and brand. It employs skilled \nprofessionals to ensure that its position with respect to the bank’s own tax matters is robust.  \n \n \n"}

For example, on February 14, 2023, the Council of the EU \nadded Russia to the list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes effective for the tax years beginning January 1, \n2024. The bank does not anticipate material implications for Deutsche Bank and its Russian operations. Furthermore, the \nbank is impacted by changes in the principles of international taxation emanating from the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit \nShifting agenda. On December 20, 2021, the OECD issued model rules for a global minimum tax under Pillar 2, the Global \nAnti-Base Erosion Model Rules. These model rules create an internationally coordinated system of taxation intended to \nensure that multinational enterprises pay a minimum level of tax of 15% in each jurisdiction in which they operate. The EU \nimplemented these model rules via a directive. The provisions under the EU directive were transposed into German law \n(“Mindeststeuergesetz” or “MinStG”). The Pillar 2 rules are generally effective for tax years beginning after December 30, \n2023. Pillar 2 global information reports and respective tax returns for 2024 are generally due in June 2026. To the extent \napplicable, Deutsche Bank AG must remit a Pillar 2 liability calculated for a jurisdiction to the German tax authorities, \nunless that jurisdiction enacts its own set of Pillar 2 rules. Of the close to 60 countries in which the bank operates, \napproximately 50% have enacted or are in the process of enacting their own set of Pillar 2 rules. The bank’s in-house tax \nfunction is monitoring developments and assessing implications. For further details see Note 34 – Income Taxes.  \nAs a matter of principle, Deutsche Bank reports its profits in the countries in which they are generated, this means that \nprofits are also taxed in those countries. Intercompany transactions are undertaken on an arm’s length basis in accordance \nwith internationally accepted OECD transfer pricing principles, giving due consideration to applicable local rules and \nrequirements. Deutsche Bank does not undertake uncommercial artificial steps for the purpose of obtaining tax benefits. \nDetails on the bank’s international operations are provided in Deutsche Bank’s 2024 Notes to the consolidated financial \nstatements, which disclose the income tax expense or benefit in the jurisdictions in which the bank operates (see Note 43 \n– Country by country reporting). For information on the domicile of the companies, names and their primary activities \nplease refer to the shareholdings list (see Note 44 – Shareholdings). The geographical location of subsidiaries and branches \nconsiders the country of incorporation or residence. \nTo enhance the understanding of the Country by country reporting (see Note 43 – Country by country reporting) the \nfollowing explanatory information is provided. The Country by country information reported is derived from the IFRS Group \naccounts of Deutsche Bank. It is, however, not directly reconcilable to other financial information in the Annual Report \nbecause of specific guidance published by the Bundesbank on December 16, 2014, which includes the requirement to \npresent the country information prior to the elimination of cross-border intragroup transactions. In line with this \nrequirement, only intragroup transactions within the same country are eliminated. As an example, the dividend income \nreceived by a group entity in country x from a subsidiary in country y is not included in the IFRS Group accounts, as these \nare eliminated in consolidation. However, they are included in and reported in the results of country x in the Country by \ncountry reporting. As a matter of principle such intra-group dividend income is generally tax-exempt in most jurisdictions \nto avoid double or multiple layers of taxation. Accordingly, these specific reporting requirements can have a significant \nimpact on the jurisdictional effective tax rate shown in the Country by country reporting, which may differ from the \ncountry’s statutory tax rate. Moreover, the disclosed income tax expense or benefit may also reflect various other \nadjustments required by tax law, e.g., non-tax-deductible expenses or tax-exempt income.  \nIn 2024, Deutsche Bank’s total income tax expense amounted to €  1.8 billion (see Consolidated Statement of Income as \nwell as Note 34 – Income Taxes) and income taxes paid during 2024 amounted to € 1.4 billion in the year 2024 (see \nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows). \n"}

Deutsche Bank systematically prioritizes these risks and assigns clear accountability \nfor identifying regulatory changes, assessing their impact, and taking the steps necessary to ensure compliance.  \nIn recent years, regulators and policymakers across the globe have created numerous rulebooks to improve transparency \non sustainable finance, increase disclosure of Environment, Social and Governance information, and promote sustainability \nin the value chain. Besides the voluntary sustainability commitments of Deutsche Bank, these regulatory initiatives also \nimpact its strategy.  \nKey regulatory acts include, among others, the EU Taxonomy, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the \nSustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), the \nGerman Supply Chain Due Diligence Act, the California laws on greenhouse gas emissions disclosure and the Singapore \nTransition Taxonomy. \nDeutsche Bank supports the increased focus on transitioning economies to a more sustainable operating model with \nsustainable finance as key tool to make this transition happen. At the same time, the bank is committed to making the very \ncomplex set of rules more practical to apply, to better reflect the sustainability successes of companies and banks and to \ndevelop a stronger steering effect. \nIn doing so and keeping the mission statement in mind, Deutsche Bank engages with all key stakeholders across the various \ntopics. Following also the Global Hausbank strategy, the bank aims to support clients across the globe with all the \nnecessary advice. In doing so, the bank provides thought leadership advice to stakeholders to ensure their sustained \nsuccess. \nIn engaging with the various policymakers across the hubs at global level Deutsche Bank aims to ensure that guidelines \nand regulations produced are interchangeable as much as possible. This would lead to more comparability and \ntransparency between reports and disclosures around ESG, which in turn would increase the usability of the disclosure \ninformation for third parties.  \nTo ensure that sustainable transition can be achieved as practical as possible, the bank acts as intermediate between \nclients and policymakers, by translating implementation challenges to the policymakers and vice versa by explaining the \nregulatory intention behind disclosure and reporting requirements to clients.

Here, the biggest steps toward reducing \nemission and adhering to the Paris agreement can and should be made.  \n2024 was a year of elections. Elections took place at the level of the European Parliament, in the United Kingdom and in \nthe United States. In addition, the European Commission’s mandate ended in November 2024 and a new college of \nCommissioners will be leading this key institution for European policymaking. This has meant that there was a hold on \nfurther policymaking that support sustainable transition for most of the year. The bank, however, saw that focus on \nsustainability towards the end of the year has picked up again.  \nKey regulatory topics in 2024 included: \n– In the European Union: Deutsche Bank main focus was on the implementation of the final Basel III rules and the review \nof the EU macroprudential framework. It further accompanied the revisions of the Markets in Financial Instruments \nDirective, of the settlement cycle and of the European securitization framework. Deutsche Bank also focused on \nsupporting ongoing work on the digital euro at the level of the ECB with its preparation phase as well as at the level of \nthe European co-legislators, dealing with the future legislative framework for the digital euro. The bank also worked on \nother important payment files, including the new Instant Payments Regulation and the review of the Payment services \nDirective. The bank underlined that the private sector and the EU institutions need to agree on a holistic vision for a \nsovereign and competitive EU payment landscape. In addition, given that it was an election year, no new proposals were \nadded to the key topics and Deutsche Bank mainly focused on addressing the challenge on how to finance Europe’s \nbroader transition. Not only from a sustainability perspective, but also from a digital perspective. Here, the bank \nconsidered that further developing European capital markets remains essential. Bank funding alone will not be able to \novercome the financing gap that exists. In that context, Deutsche Bank also participated in debates on investor \nprotection and on the Retail Investment Strategy. Transition finance fortunately became central in each discussion on \nhow to transition corporates and small and medium enterprises (SME’s) to a greener, long-term sustainable business \nmodel \n– In the United Kingdom, regulatory changes to the financial services framework continued throughout the year and there \nhas been relative continuity despite the change in government to focus on areas in the financial services framework \nwhich contribute to growth of the U.K. economy. Deutsche Bank focused the advocacy efforts on changes which \nenhance primary market efficiency, such as the changes to the Listing Act which entered into force on 29 July 2024 as \nwell as the ongoing changes to the Prospectus Regime and has shared the bank’s views on key areas to focus on in the \ncontext of the Pensions Review. Deutsche Bank also supported key topics of relevance for its London branch with \nregards to secondary markets, such as the remaining changes in the context of the Wholesale Markets Review, including \non transparency rules under the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (U.K. MiFIR) and the bank – via trade \nassociations – contributed to the work of the accelerated settlement taskforce on a move to a one day settlement cycle \n(also known as T+1) in the U.K. In the area of sustainable finance, the bank supported the work on the development of \nguidance for sector-specific transition plans. Lastly, Deutsche Bank engaged via trade associations in the ongoing work \non U.K. digital gilts and the broader digitalization of the financial services framework with the aim of contributing to a \nfuture-proof regulatory framework. \n– In the United States: the main focus was on the prudential regulators proposed rule to implement the Basel Committee’s \nfinalized Basel III framework. The proposal raised capital requirements for banks with over U.S.$ 100 billion in assets \nand removes much of the differentiation among institutions’ requirements. There remains significant uncertainty \nregarding how many changes will be made in the final rule as well as in the timing of finalization.

First, via direct \nengagement with policymakers Deutsche Bank learns more about upcoming regulatory developments. Second, via \nmembership of the various trade associations the bank is also notified of new developments. Third, the bank monitors and \ntracks new regulatory developments across key business and political hubs and shares this information across all its \ndivisions via an internal daily newsletter. In general, the bank engages throughout the entire policy discussion process \nwhich can vary between one and a half years and two to three years, depending on the jurisdiction.  \nBased on these interactions Deutsche Bank engages with internal and external stakeholders. Many of the regulatory \ndevelopments on the sustainability front are not unique to the financial sector but cut across all sectors. These therefore \nimpact the bank’s clients across the globe as well. Given that Deutsche Bank can only be successful if its clients are \nsuccessful, the bank engages with many different policymakers to gather a great deal of information on upcoming \nregulatory requirements affecting the bank and its clients. Deutsche Bank therefore not only tries to translate this into risk \nand opportunities for the bank itself but also shares its insights with clients so that they can be better prepared for dealing \nwith new regulatory requirements. Via these client interactions, the bank also receives feedback on what hurdles clients \nare facing when implementing new standards. This in turn is very useful information for policymakers to receive as well. It \nis in Deutsche Bank’s best interest that the policies and regulatory frameworks that are written work in practice and lead \nto the transition of the bank and its clients towards more sustainable business models.  \nBy actively engaging in the political process to lobby for (ESG)-effective and efficient regulation, Deutsche Bank believes \nthat this can have a positive impact on the environment and society at large. The bank also sees it as an opportunity to be \nperceived as sustainability leader by engaging in policy debates as well as having the possibility to shape the political and \nregulatory environment that is supportive of the bank's business model. The principal aim of the bank’s advocacy activities \nis to support governments and regulators to create a business environment that allows for growth while respecting \nenvironmental and societal needs. \nDeutsche Bank's engagement with regards to ESG is focused on topics where the bank can leverage its expertise as \nfinancial service provider e.g., on upscaling sustainable finance markets and transition financing. The bank also brings into \nthe political debate the challenges its clients face in their transition. \nOn the issue of Transition Finance, Deutsche Bank stated that focusing solely on “green” finance will not be sufficient to \nmeet the Green Deal and that more emphasis needs to be placed on funding of transitional activities, especially of high-\nemitting sectors. To be able to provide this financing, a principle-based guidance for Transition Finance linked to transition \nplans based on sectoral roadmaps to net-zero emissions, needs to be developed. In addition, the EU Taxonomy needs to \nbecome more workable to allow for Transition Finance and it should be supported by Industrial policy measures to \naccelerate the transformation. \nDeutsche Bank also supported the objective of the recently adopted Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive and \npointed to the fact that the bank already carries out a bespoke environmental and social risk due diligence when e.g., \nproviding loans. However, it also clarified that in order to remain effective, the new directive needs to be risk-based, \nappropriate and not increase bureaucracy across client business. Also, the scope of the financial services covered should \nbe limited to loans provided to direct clients, as they are long-term oriented. Deutsche Bank further pointed to competitive \ndisadvantages in markets where the bank and its clients are competing against institutions who are not subject to these \nobligations. \nESRS 2 MDR-P, ESRS 2 MDR-A, ESRS G1-5 \nThe Government & Public Affairs function is responsible for conducting transparent and constructive government and \nregulatory engagement on behalf of the bank as outlined in its mission statement: \n“On behalf of Deutsche Bank, Government & Public Affairs engages governments, policymakers, and the industry to create \nthe best possible conditions for the bank’s clients to thrive and to help them navigate geopolitical uncertainty.

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 377, "text": " \n345 \nDeutsche Bank  \nGovernance information \nAnnual Report 2024 \nData protection \nData protection \nIn most countries Deutsche Bank conducts business there is a data protection (also referenced as “data privacy”) law. These \nare derived from the privacy related statements in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, the UN Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights or the European Convention on Human Rights. Further details on Human Rights in general can be found in \nthe corresponding chapter of this Sustainability Statement. Deutsche Bank recognizes that data protection is an important \nsocial value as clients, employees and other stakeholders expect that the personal data they entrusted to the bank is \ntreated with the highest care. The bank is therefore committed to protecting personal data, complying with the General \nData Protection Regulation and similar laws, and meeting the related demands of clients, employees, business partners, \nand regulators. \nGovernance \nESRS 2 GOV-2 \nGroup Data Privacy is a specialized, independent risk control function for data protection at Deutsche Bank. As a Second \nLine of Defense function, Group Data Privacy defines data protection principles and sets consistent policy requirements \nand minimum control standards to comply with applicable data protection laws and regulations. Group Data Privacy is \nsupported by local Data Protection Officers in the countries where Deutsche Bank conducts business and the Chief Data \nPrivacy Officer has a direct functional reporting line to the Chief Legal Officer who is a member of the Management Board.  \nGroup Data Privacy employees are regular participants in business and infrastructure forums in which new initiatives that \nmay involve the processing of personal data are discussed. Group Data Privacy also advises the bank’s workers councils in \nrelation to the processing of employee personal data. \nIn addition, Group Data Privacy closely collaborates with the Technology, Data and Innovation function and the \nInformation Security function (Chief Security Office) to implement specific data protection principles, e.g., aiming to \nensure the security of personal data via encryption of emails according to their classification or access rights controls. \nDetails on information security can be found in the corresponding chapter of this Sustainability Statement. \nStrategy \nESRS 2 SBM-3  \nData Protection is an integral part of Deutsche Bank’s culture and conduct. Business and infrastructure units comply with \napplicable data protection laws in achieving their objectives (including Artificial Intelligence initiatives). This is ensured by \ndefining and continually enhancing internal data protection policy requirements and the related controls framework. \nIn 2024, Deutsche Bank launched a framework document comprising the key data protection principles as group-wide \nstandards. The global data protection policy has been revised to further strengthen data protection responsibilities for \nemployees and specific roles in the organization. The policy is planned to be further updated in 2025 to consolidate \nexisting and include new country-specific particularities. \nGroup Data Privacy is the subject matter expert function for the interpretation and application of data protection laws and \nregulations at Deutsche Bank. It monitors and assesses regulatory developments in data protection on an ongoing basis. \nIts aim is to provide a current set of requirements according to which data protection should be carried out by the bank \nand to implement controls to demonstrate the organization conducts business in compliance with data protection laws \nand regulations.  \nAs an internal partner, Group Data Privacy advises on and monitors the lawful collection, processing, and use of personal \ndata by the bank’s business and infrastructure units including where they engage third parties who process personal data \non behalf of Deutsche Bank. Another key factor in ensuring adequate data protection in all operating processes are \nemployee training and regular awareness campaigns which are kept up to date, as required.  \nFurthermore, Group Data Privacy engages in the further development of data protection case law and in the review of \nsupervisory authority guidance documents. As a member of different industry groups, notably the Association of German \nBanks and the European Banking Federation, Deutsche Bank represented by Group Data Privacy employees, actively \nshares best practice, aligns standards, for example standard privacy notice templates or terms and conditions, and \ndiscusses data protection related regulatory issues with other financial institutions. This helps to ensure that the bank’s \ndata protection requirements and practices for processing personal data reflect current industry best practices and keep \npace with the evolving regulatory environment. \n"}

Personal data breaches \ncould have negative impacts for affected individuals such as identity theft, financial loss, damage in credit score, and \nemotional distress in the short term. \nGroup Data Privacy defines data protection principles and sets consistent policy requirements and minimum control \nstandards to comply with applicable data protection laws and regulations and to ensure a proper assessment and handling \nof potential personal data breaches.  \nThe minimum standards of conduct for all employees are provided in Deutsche Bank’s Code of Conduct. Failure to comply \nwith the Code or breaches of the requirements within the global data protection policy may result in disciplinary action, \nup to termination of employment. \nIn 2024, Group Data Privacy has continued the review and enhancement of the bank’s data protection policy framework \nand governance. The key data protection principles and how Deutsche Bank complies with these have been published in \nan overarching framework document. It refers to the existing bank’s policies that address these key principles, for example \nto the information security policy approved by the Chief Security Officer which defines requirements to preserve the \nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets in general. The global data protection policy has been \nrevised to further specify data protection requirements for all employees and particular roles in the organization. These \ndocuments have been approved by the Chief Data Privacy Officer and published on the internal policy portal which is \naccessible to all employees. The policy is reviewed on an annual basis and is planned to be further updated in 2025 to \nconsolidate any country-specific particularities in its annex which are currently captured in separate local procedures.  \nThe policy sets out Deutsche Bank’s group-wide and globally applicable minimum requirements for data protection and \nprivacy: \n– Requirements for all employees on the usage of personal data and the escalation of potential personal data breaches  \n– Specific requirements for employees managing supplier (also referenced as “vendor”) engagements, for example that a \ncontract must contain appropriate data protection provisions in case personal data is processed by a supplier \nFurther, it provides requirements for business and infrastructure unit heads to ensure  \n– Group Data Privacy is notified of any new activities that involve the processing of personal data, \n– requests from individuals concerning their rights granted by applicable data protection laws or regulations are \nidentified and promptly dealt with, for example access rights requests or requests to have their data transferred to other \nservice providers, \n– consent from an individual is obtained in a lawful manner, for example via opt-in, and  \n– individuals are informed about what is happening with their personal data via a privacy notice  \nWhere legally required, these notices are directly provided to Deutsche Bank clients and employees by business and \ninfrastructure units or made available on their respective public websites including the website specific privacy notices. \nThe Corporate Bank, Investment Bank, Private Bank for private clients and high net worth individuals and Asset \nManagement publish privacy notices for clients. Employees are provided with privacy notices as required, for example via \nthe Deutsche Bank career portal. These notices provide an overview of how Deutsche Bank processes personal data, to \nwhich third parties (including suppliers) data might be transferred to and the rights of individuals whose personal data is \nbeing processed, under data protection law. Suppliers who process personal data on behalf of Deutsche Bank are \ncontractually obligated to process personal data only based on the instructions provided by the bank and to comply with \napplicable data protection requirements. If the bank receives data protection related requests, for example access right \nor rectification requests, or complaints from individuals, Group Data Privacy is involved on an individual basis and consults \nwith relevant internal stakeholders and the affected individuals, as required. \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 379, "text": " \n347 \nDeutsche Bank  \nGovernance information \nAnnual Report 2024 \nData protection \nBased on Deutsche Bank’s Group-wide Non-Financial Risk Management framework, Group Data Privacy as Second Line of \nDefense Risk Control Function has established minimum control standards which the business and infrastructure units \nmust adhere to for mitigating data protection risk. These standards have been updated in 2024 in line with the revised \npolicy. A key minimum control standard requires the business and infrastructure units to notify Group Data Privacy of new \nactivities that involve processing of personal data in the bank, for example when processing personal data using artificial \nintelligence. Group Data Privacy assesses the permissibility with the objective that personal data is only processed for \nspecified, explicit and legitimate purposes and further applicable data protection requirements are met. To achieve this, \nGroup Data Privacy employees are regular participants in business and infrastructure forums in which new initiatives that \nmay involve the processing of personal data are discussed. Controls preventing data protection risk are integrated in \nGroup-wide governance processes like new product approval or third-party (vendor) risk management as appropriate. The \neffectiveness of these controls is reviewed according to a standard assurance process governed by the Non-Financial Risk \nManagement function.  \nIn 2024, the coverage of the Group-wide third-party (vendor) risk management process was extended to services which \nwere not in scope of this governance process before. This will ensure the services are subject to the same data protection \nstandards embedded in this governance process. Any deviations to the standards will be escalated to Group Data Privacy \nand mitigating measures agreed, as required.  \nMonitoring and testing the effectiveness of Deutsche Bank’s implementation of applicable data protection requirements \nwas continued by Group Data Privacy as part of its Second Line of Defense responsibilities and no major deficiencies were \nidentified. The results were considered by Group Data Privacy in the bank’s Group-wide annual risk and control assessment \nto review and challenge the business and infrastructure units’ own assessment of their data protection risk exposure and \ncontrol effectiveness.  \nGroup Data Privacy continuously monitors emerging data protection laws and regulations and shares information about \nthem with the local Data Protection Officers to assess their relevance and potential consequences for the bank and, if \nnecessary, adjusts the policy framework as well as the minimum control standards. If a need for changes to processes and \nproducts is identified, implementation actions are agreed with the business and infrastructure units. \nIn 2024, Switzerland confirmed that the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework is an adequate mechanism which allows Swiss \norganizations to transfer personal data to U.S. organizations certified to the framework. Furthermore, amendments to the \nTurkish Personal Data Protection Law entered into force on June 1, 2024, and additional U.S. state privacy laws have been \nadopted. Group Data Privacy continues to closely monitor the further development of the British Data Protection and \nDigital Information Bill as well as several EU legislation as part of the EU´s strategy on digitalization and cybersecurity and \nthe interplay with data protection, for example the ePrivacy Regulation. \nEmployee training on the implications of data protection/privacy laws for the bank’s day-to-day business is a key factor in \nensuring adequate data protection in all operating processes. Deutsche Bank requires mandatory data protection training \nfor all employees including eligible contractor staff. The bank continually assesses its data protection training offering to \nstrengthen the data protection culture and updates the training as necessary. In 2024, Group Data Privacy launched an \nenhanced mandatory global data protection eLearning adapting to new laws and regulations and addressing emerging \ndata protection risks given the growing usage of AI technologies. The training encompasses the content of the data \nprotection and privacy policy, the key compliance requirements with applicable legal rules for handling personal data and \nwhat steps must be taken in the event of a personal data breach. Depending on the employees’ country, this training also \nprovides tailored modules with relevant use cases and test questions to pass. For Deutsche Bank employees, failure to \ncomplete this training and late completion can result in disciplinary consequences. In 2024, an eLearning completion rate \nof 99.29% was achieved for the mandatory data protection training compared to 99.96% in 2023. \nTo reinforce the key data protection messages and a corresponding culture, awareness of employees on data protection \nis fostered by internal online as well as in person events and through internal platforms. For example, in 2024 Group Data \nPrivacy organized several country- and business-specific trainings, issued monthly newsletters on new data protection and \nprivacy laws and regulations and cooperated with the Chief Security Office on training initiatives.  \nThese measures reflect a global effort to raise more awareness amongst employees on the importance of data protection \nand privacy, on handling of personal data, where to get support for data protection matters in the bank, what are \nindividual’s rights, best practices for organizations to protect personal data, principles and trends in data protection and \nprivacy, navigating the landscape of corresponding laws and regulations, what can be the consequences of poor data \nprotection practices as well as on the importance of building trust and maintaining brand reputation in today’s data driven \nbusiness landscape. \n \n \n"}

As such wording and terms may be interpreted differently by regulators or courts, the legal conformity \nof any measurement or evaluation of sustainability matters made on the basis of these interpretations is uncertain.  \nThese inherent limitations also apply to the assurance work on the group sustainability statement. \nResponsibilities of the auditor for the assurance work on the group sustainability statement \nOur objectives are to express a limited assurance conclusion, based on our assurance engagement, about whether any \nmatters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the group sustainability statement is not prepared, in all \nmaterial respects, in accordance with the CSRD, the relevant German legal and other European requirements and the \nelaborative criteria presented by the Company’s executive directors, and to issue an assurance report that includes our \nconclusion on the group sustainability statement. \nAs part of a limited assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised), we exercise professional judgment \nand maintain professional skepticism. We also: \n– Obtain an understanding of the process to prepare the group sustainability statement, including the materiality \nassessment process carried out by the Company to identify the information to be reported in the group sustainability \nstatement. \n– Identify disclosures that are likely to be materially misstated due to fraud or error, design and perform procedures to \naddress such disclosures and obtain limited assurance to support our conclusion. The risk of not detecting a material \nmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, \nas fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. \nFurthermore, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement in information from the value chain originating from \nsources outside of the Company’s control (information from the value chain) is usually higher than the risk of not \ndetecting a material misstatement in information originating from sources within the Company’s control, as both the \nCompany’s executive directors and we as auditors usually have limited direct access to the sources of information from \nthe value chain. \n– Evaluate the forward-looking information, including the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions. There is a \nsubstantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the forward-looking information. \nSummary of the work performed by the auditor \nA limited assurance engagement involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the sustainability information. \nThe nature, timing and extent of the procedures selected depend on our professional judgment. \nIn conducting our limited assurance engagement, we:  \n– Evaluated the overall suitability of the criteria presented by the executive directors in the group sustainability \nstatement. \n"}

The bank’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed \nunder the supervision of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable \nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting. In addition to the preparation of the company’s consolidated \nfinancial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) \nas issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the European Union (EU). The bank’s \ninternal control over financial reporting includes disclosure controls and procedures designed to prevent misstatements. \nRisks in Financial Reporting \nThe primary risks in financial reporting are that either financial statements do not present a true and fair view due to \ninadvertent or intentional errors (fraud) or the publication of financial statements is not performed on a timely basis. These \nrisks may reduce investor confidence or cause reputational damage and may have legal consequences including banking \nregulatory interventions. A lack of fair presentation arises when one or more financial statement amounts, or disclosures \ncontain misstatements (or omissions) that are material. Misstatements are deemed material if they could, individually or in \naggregate, influence economic decisions that users make because of the financial statements. \nTo confine those risks of financial reporting, management of the Group has established internal control over financial \nreporting with the aim of providing reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatements. In addition, an \nassessment was conducted of the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control over financial reporting. This was based on \nthe Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway \nCommission (COSO). COSO recommends the establishment of specific objectives to facilitate the design and evaluate \nadequacy of a control system. As a result, in establishing internal control over financial reporting, management has \nadopted the following financial statement objectives: \n– Existence - assets and liabilities exist and transactions have occurred;\n– Completeness - all transactions are recorded and account balances are included in the financial statements;\n– Valuation - assets, liabilities and transactions are recorded in the financial statements at the appropriate amounts;\n– Rights, Obligations and Ownership – rights, obligations and ownership are appropriately recorded as assets and\nliabilities;\n– Presentation and Disclosures - classification, disclosure and presentation of financial reporting is appropriate;\n– Safeguarding of assets - unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets is prevented or detected in a timely\nmanner.\nHowever, any internal control system, including internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well conceived \nand operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute assurance that the objectives of that control system are met. \nAs such, disclosure controls and procedures or systems for internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all \nerrors; inadvertent or intentional errors (fraud). Furthermore, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future \nperiods, are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree \nof compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. In addition, the design of a control system must \nreflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. \nControls to Minimize the Risk of Financial Reporting Misstatement \nThe system of internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: \n– Pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the company’s assets;\n– Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of the company’s management and;\n– Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition \nof the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n"}

This evaluation incorporates an assessment of the effectiveness of the control \nenvironment as well as individual controls which make up the system of internal control over financial reporting and \nconsiders: \n– The financial misstatement risk of the financial statement line items, considering such factors as materiality and the \nsusceptibility of the financial statement item to misstatement; and,  \n– The susceptibility of identified controls to failure, considering such factors as the degree of automation, complexity, \nand risk of management override, competence of personnel and the level of judgment required.  \nThese factors determine in their entirety the type and scope of the evidence required by § 315 HGB, which the \nmanagement needs to assess whether or not the established internal control over financial reporting is effective. The \nevidence itself is generated from procedures integrated within the daily responsibilities of staff or from procedures \nimplemented specifically for purposes of the internal control over financial reporting evaluation. Information from other \nsources also form an important component of the evaluation since such evidence may either bring additional control issues \nto the attention of management or may corroborate findings. Such information sources may include: \n– Reports on audits carried out by or on behalf of regulatory authorities;  \n– External Auditor reports; and, \n– Reports commissioned to evaluate the effectiveness of outsourced processes to third parties.  \nIn addition, Group Audit evaluates the design and operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting by \nperforming periodic and ad-hoc risk-based audits. Reports are produced summarizing the results from each audit which \nare distributed to the responsible managers for the activities concerned. These reports also provide evidence to support \nthe annual evaluation by management of the overall operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. \nAs a result of the evaluation, management has concluded that internal control over financial reporting is appropriately \ndesigned and operating effectively as of December 31, 2024. \n"}

The number of Management Board \nmembers is determined by the Supervisory Board. According to the Articles of Association, the Management Board has at \nleast three members. The Supervisory Board may appoint one or two members of the Management Board as Chairpersons \nof the Management Board. Members of the Management Board may be appointed for a maximum term of up to five years. \nThey may be reappointed or have their term extended for one or more terms of up to a maximum of five years each. The \nGerman Co-Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz; Section 31) requires a majority of at least two thirds of the \nmembers of the Supervisory Board to appoint members of the Management Board. If such majority is not achieved, the \nMediation Committee shall give, within one month, a recommendation for the appointment to the Management Board. \nThe Supervisory Board will then appoint the members of the Management Board with the majority of its members. If such \nappointment fails, the Chairperson of the Supervisory Board shall have two votes in a new vote. If a required member of \nthe Management Board has not been appointed, the Local Court (Amtsgericht) in Frankfurt am Main shall, in urgent cases, \nmake the necessary appointments upon motion by any party concerned (Section 85 of the Stock Corporation Act). \nPursuant to the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz) and Regulation (EU) No 468/2014 of the European Central Bank \n(SSM Framework Regulation) evidence must be provided to the European Central Bank (ECB), the German Federal \nFinancial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) and the Deutsche Bundesbank that the member of the Management Board has \nadequate theoretical and practical experience of the businesses of the Bank as well as managerial experience before the \nmember is appointed (Sections 24 (1) No. 1 and 25c (1) of the Banking Act, Article 93 of the SSM Framework Regulation). \nThe Supervisory Board may revoke the appointment of an individual as member of the Management Board or as \nChairperson of the Management Board for good cause. Such cause includes in particular a gross breach of duties, the \ninability to manage the Bank properly or a vote of no-confidence by the shareholders’ meeting (Hauptversammlung, \nreferred to as the General Meeting), unless such vote of no-confidence was made for obviously arbitrary reasons. \nThe ECB or the BaFin may appoint a special representative and transfer to such special representative the responsibility \nand powers of individual members of the Management Board if such members are not trustworthy or do not have the \nrequired competencies or if the credit institution does not have the required number of Management Board members. In \nany such case, the responsibility and powers of the Management Board members concerned are suspended (Section 45c \n(1) through (3) of the Banking Act, Article 93 (2) of the SSM Framework Regulation). \nRules Governing the Amendment of the Articles of Association  \nAny amendment of the Articles of Association requires a resolution of the General Meeting (Section 179 of the Stock \nCorporation Act). The authority to amend the Articles of Association in so far as such amendments merely relate to the \nwording, such as changes of the share capital as a result of the issuance out of authorized capital, has been assigned to \nthe Supervisory Board by the Articles of Association of Deutsche Bank (Section 20 (3)). Pursuant to the Articles of \nAssociation, the resolutions of the General Meeting are taken by a simple majority of votes and, in so far as a majority of \ncapital stock is required, by a simple majority of capital stock, except where law or the Articles of Association determine \notherwise (Section 20 (1)).

The management of \nDeutsche Bank Group is based on IFRS results of the bank’s corporate divisions. Deutsche Bank AG is fully integrated in \nthe initiatives and target setting of Deutsche Bank Group. The performance of the Group is ultimately driving the \nperformance of Deutsche Bank AG. Further, the bank has utilized the option under Section 2a of the German Banking Act \n(KWG) with respect to regulatory capital so that regulatory capital ratios are only applicable on Group level.  \nTherefore, information that has been provided regarding Deutsche Bank Group in this combined management report in \ngeneral also is relevant and applies to Deutsche Bank AG. Additional information that facilitates an understanding of \nDeutsche Bank AG is contained in this section. The financial information in this section has been prepared in accordance \nwith the German Commercial Code (“Handelsgesetzbuch”, HGB), unless stated otherwise. Further details on financial \ninformation prepared in accordance with HGB can be found in the notes to the financial statements for Deutsche Bank AG \nin a separate report. \nDeutsche Bank AG Performance \nOne parameter to evaluate the performance of the Group is the ability to make distributions to shareholders. This ability \ndepends on the availability of distributable profits of Deutsche Bank AG determined in accordance with HGB. Beyond that \nthe financial information of Deutsche Bank AG prepared in accordance with HGB is generally less relevant to assess or \nsteer the Group’s financial performance due to the circumstances set forth in the introduction above.  \nIn 2024, Deutsche Bank AG recorded a net profit of € 2.9 billion compared to net profit of € 5.0 billion in prior year. \nThe operating profit of € 2.5 billion was lower by € 3.0 billion compared to prior year. Lower trading results and lower net \ninterest income, partly offset by higher commission income led to decrease of total revenues by € 337 million. Higher net \nexpenses for litigation, up by € 1.6 billion, negative net results from banking book derivatives, down by € 566 million and a \nlower net result from securities held in the liquidity reserve, down by € 505 million, added significantly to the reduction in \noperation profit.  \nThe result outside operating profit was mainly driven by net positive valuation adjustments of investments in affiliated \ncompanies of € 1.6 billion. A tax expense of € 955 million led to the net income of € 2.9 billion.  \nThe Management Board and the Supervisory Board will propose to the Annual General Meeting to pay a dividend of \n€ 0.68 per share, appropriate € 800 million to the revenue reserves and to carry forward the remaining distributable profit.  \n"}

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 415, "text": " \n383 \nDeutsche Bank  \nStandalone parent company information (HGB) \nAnnual Report 2024 \nManagement of Deutsche Bank AG within the Group \nManagement of Deutsche Bank AG within the Group  \nThe content in this chapter should be read in conjunction with the respective group sections in this Annual Report, \nespecially “Risk Report”, “Outlook”, “Risks and Opportunities” and “Internal control over financial reporting”. \nRisk Management \nThe impact of the risks on Deutsche Bank AG cannot be isolated from the effects on Deutsche Bank’s other legal entities, \nmainly driven by: \n– The Group’s management structure, including its corporate divisions follows its customers’ needs. The legal structure \nis determined by local legislation and therefore does not necessarily follow the management structure. For example, \nlocal legislation can determine whether the Group’s business in a certain country is conducted by a branch of Deutsche \nBank AG or by a separate subsidiary. However, the management has to monitor the risks in the bank’s business – \nirrespective of whether it is transacted by a branch or a subsidiary. \n– Adequate risk monitoring and management requires knowledge of the extent to which the Group’s profit situation \ndepends on the development of certain risk factors, i.e., on the creditworthiness of individual customers or securities \nissuers or on movements in market prices. The respective exposures therefore need to be analyzed across legal entities. \nEspecially for the credit risk attached to a borrower, as it is irrelevant whether the credit exposure to a company is \nspread over several Group companies or concentrated on Deutsche Bank AG. Separate monitoring of the risk affecting \nDeutsche Bank AG alone would neglect the potential exposure facing the Group and, indirectly, Deutsche Bank AG – \nas the parent – if the company became insolvent. \n– Individual risk factors are sometimes correlated, and in some cases, they are independent of each other. If estimates of \nthe nature and extent of this correlation are available, the Group’s management can significantly reduce the overall risk \nby diversifying its businesses across customer groups, issuers and countries. The risk correlation is also independent of \nthe Group’s legal and divisional structure. Therefore, management can only optimize the risk-mitigating effects of \ndiversification if it manages them Group-wide and across legal entities. \nFor the reasons mentioned, the identification, monitoring and management of all risks in Deutsche Bank AG are integrated \ninto the Group-wide risk management process. Following Group policies, Deutsche Bank AG adheres to the respective legal \nand regulatory requirements. \nThe Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of Deutsche Bank AG stands at 122.1% as of December 31, 2024, compared to 127.5% as \nof December 31, 2023. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) amounts to 110.5% as of December 31, 2024, compared to \n110.1% as of December 31, 2023. Both ratios are calculated separately to ensure an appropriate level of liquidity and stable \nfunding at Deutsche Bank AG. \nOutlook and Strategy \nDeutsche Bank AG as the parent company of the Group defines the strategy and planning for the individual Group \nDivisions. Deutsche Bank AG participates in the results of the Group Divisions through own activities and profit distribution \nfrom subsidiaries. Therefore, the Group’s outlook encompasses all Group Divisions and is not limited to the parent \ncompany. In addition, financial key performance indicators are solely defined on Group level, except for the amount of \ndistributable profit. \n \n \n"}

Due to the \nabove-mentioned valuation methodology, there might be no offsetting effect from lower pension obligations if interest \nrates are rising. \n– Potential requirement to set up a provision according to German accounting pronouncement IDW RS BFA 3 in case the \ninterest-bearing banking book does not generate an interest margin sufficient to cover expected credit risk costs and \nadministrative expenses. A persisting low interest rate environment and the treatment of coupon payments related to \nthe AT1 instruments as expenses under HGB increase this risk. \nIn addition, profits or retained earnings from affiliated companies might not allow for sufficient dividend payments to \nDeutsche Bank AG to facilitate dividend payments by Deutsche Bank AG as targeted. \nOpportunities \nDeutsche Bank AG as a solo entity reporting under HGB may have additional opportunities compared to the Group in that \nrespect that certain transactions in a given year are reported in a more beneficial manner than for the Group under IFRS, \nsuch as realized gains which may be recognized in the income statement under IFRS in an earlier period. \nIn addition, there is the possibility that Deutsche Bank AG as parent entity shows profits in a given year that are higher than \nits contribution to the Group’s net income, resulting from increased profit distributions from affiliated companies. \nInternal control over financial reporting \n \nThe controls that are performed for the Group’s Annual Statements under IFRS apply to the bank’s financial statements \nunder HGB accordingly. In addition to these controls, specific HGB related controls are implemented which include: \n– Inter-branch reconciliation and elimination are performed for HGB specific balances; and,  \n– Analytical reviews of revaluation and reclassification items between IFRS and HGB on the level of foreign branches and \nthe German headquarters. \nSustainability Statement for Deutsche Bank AG \nDeutsche Bank AG as the parent company of the Group defines the governance, strategy, impact, risk and opportunity \nmanagement, metrics and targets for material sustainability matters. As Deutsche Bank AG substantially represents the \nGroup for key metrics (e.g. total assets of the Group),  such key sustainability elements are solely defined at Group level \nwith the exception of specifically highlighted subsidiaries as outlined in the Sustainability Statement of Deutsche Bank \nGroup. Therefore, the details pursuant to Section 340a (1a) German Commercial Code (HGB) in conjunction with Section \n289b (3) HGB can be found in the Sustainability Statement within the Combined Management Report of this Annual \nReport. As the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) issued by the European Union was not transposed into \nGerman law as of 31 December 2024, the bank applied the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) as \nreporting framework as allowed by Section 289d HGB and, on that basis, discloses governance, strategy, impact, risk and \nopportunity management, metrics and targets for material sustainability matters. \n"}

Deutsche Bank together with all \nentities in which Deutsche Bank has a controlling financial interest (collectively the “Group”, or “Deutsche Bank”) is a global \nprovider of a full range of corporate and investment banking, private clients and asset management products and services. \nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are stated in euros, the presentation currency of the Group. All \nfinancial information presented in million euros has been rounded to the nearest million. The consolidated financial \nstatements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the \nInternational Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and endorsed by the European Union (EU). \nPrior to publication on March 13, 2025, the Supervisory Board approved the Consolidated Financial Statements 2024 of \nthe Group on March 12, 2025, which were drawn up by the Management Board on March 6, 2025. \nEU carve-out \nThe Group applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk (fair value macro hedges) in \naccordance with the EU carve out version of IAS 39. The purpose of applying the EU carve out version of IAS 39 is to align \nthe Group’s hedge accounting approach with its risk management practice and the accounting practice of its major \nEuropean peers. Under the EU carve out version of IAS 39 fair value macro hedge accounting may be applied to core \ndeposits. In addition, the EU carve out version of IAS 39 hedge ineffectiveness is only recognized when the revised estimate \nof the amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets falls below the original designated amount of that bucket. If the \nrevised amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets is more than the original designated amount, then there is no \nhedge ineffectiveness. Under IFRS as issued by the IASB, hedge accounting for fair value macro hedges cannot be applied \nto core deposits. In addition, under IFRS as issued by the IASB hedge ineffectiveness arises for all fair value macro hedge \naccounting relationships whenever the revised estimate of the amount of cash flows in scheduled time buckets is either \nmore or less than the original designated amount of that bucket. The EU carve out version of IAS 39 also removes the \nprohibition on identifying a benchmark risk component in a financial instrument priced at sub–benchmark. This may arise \nwhen financial instruments carry a negative spread such that the identified non–contractually specified risk component is \nlarger than the interest carry on the contract itself. \nFor the financial year ended December 31, 2024, the application of the EU carve-out version of IAS 39 had a negative \nimpact of € 1.4 billion on profit before tax and of € 976 million on profit after tax. For the financial year ended December \n31, 2023, the application of the EU carve-out had a negative impact of € 2.3 billion on profit before taxes and of \n€ 1.6 billion million on profit post taxes.  \nThe Group’s regulatory capital and ratios thereof are also reported on the basis of the EU carve-out version of IAS 39. The \nimpact on total equity also impacts the calculation of the CET1 capital ratio. For the financial year ended December 31, \n2024, application of the EU carve-out had a negative impact on the CET1 capital ratio of about 68 basis points and a \nnegative impact of about 43 basis points for the financial year ended December 31, 2023. \nIFRS 7 disclosures (including climate risk related disclosures)  \nDisclosures about the nature and the extent of risks arising from financial instruments as required by IFRS 7, “Financial \nInstruments: Disclosures” are set forth in the Risk Report section of the Combined Management Report and are an integral \npart of the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 425, "text": " \n \n393  \nDeutsche Bank  \nNotes to the consolidated financial statements \nAnnual Report 2024 \n01 – Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates \nDisclosures on climate related risk can be found in the section, “Risk and Capital Management”, chapter “Enterprise Risk \nManagement“ (Environmental, Social and Governance Risk) as well as in the section “Risk and Capital Performance”, \nchapter “Credit Risk Exposure” (Focus Areas 2024) in the Risk Report. The Group is exposed to environmental, social and \ngovernance (ESG) risk. The following are examples of how such risk may impact the financial results of the Group: \n– Increases in the frequency and severity of climate events could impact client ability to service principal and interest \npayments under instruments subject to IFRS 9. \n– Failure to comply with environmental and social legislation may impact client ability to generate sustainable returns to \nservice their loans. \n– If in the future clients do not hold sufficient insurance for physical assets against certain risks (e.g., flooding), this may \nimpact the value of collateral held against certain type of loans. \nThe Group considers such ESG risk as part of the credit risk assessment and due diligence process before relevant clients \nare granted credit. The Group also manages its credit portfolio within the established risk appetite and limits. Further \naccounting considerations, including risk consideration, for ESG indexed loans can be found in the section “Financial \nassets” in the description of the material accounting policies below. \nThese audited disclosures are marked in light blue in the Risk Report. \nAs of January 1, 2024, the Group discontinued its disclosure relating to exposures to Russia and the impact on allowance \nfor credit losses as a result of the war in Ukraine. The Group continues to monitor its risks related to Russia as part of its \nregular risk management activities and enhanced governance oversight in place. \nSince the beginning of the fourth quarter 2023, High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA, as defined in the Commission Delegated \nRegulation (EU) 2015/61) is a key limit per the Group’s liquidity risk appetite, replacing the previously reported Liquidity \nReserve. HQLA comprise available cash and cash equivalents and unencumbered high quality liquid securities (including \ngovernment and government guaranteed bonds), representing the most readily available and most important \ncountermeasure in a stress event. Accordingly, the Group discontinued the disclosure of Liquidity Reserves from 2024 \nonwards. \nCritical accounting estimates \nThe preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions for certain \ncategories of assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities \nand disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date, and the reported amounts of revenue and \nexpenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from management’s estimates. The Group’s material \naccounting policies are described in “Material Accounting Policies”. \nCertain of the Group’s accounting policies require critical accounting estimates that involve complex and subjective \njudgments and the use of assumptions, some of which may be for matters that are inherently uncertain and susceptible to \nchange. Such critical accounting estimates could change from period to period and may have a material impact on the \nGroup’s financial condition, changes in financial condition or results of operations. Critical accounting estimates could also \ninvolve estimates where management could have reasonably used another estimate in the current accounting period. The \nGroup has identified the following material accounting policies that involve critical accounting estimates: \n– The impairment of loans and provisions for off-balance sheet positions (see “Impairment of Loans and Provision for Off-\nbalance Sheet Positions” below)  \n– The impairment of financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (see “Impairment of Loans and \nProvision for Off-balance Sheet Positions” below)  \n– The determination of fair value (see “Determination of Fair Value” below) \n– The recognition of trade date profit (see “Recognition of Trade Date Profit” below) \n– The impairment of goodwill and other intangibles (see “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” below) \n– The recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets (see “Income Taxes” below) \n– The accounting for legal and regulatory contingencies and uncertain tax positions (see “Provisions” below) \nMaterial accounting policies \nThe following is a description of the significant accounting policies of the Group. Except for the changes in accounting \npolicies and changes in accounting estimates described previously and noted below these policies have been consistently \napplied for 2022, 2023 and 2024. \n"}

Control over an entity is evidenced by \nthe Group’s ability to exercise its power in order to affect any variable returns that the Group is exposed to through its \ninvolvement with the entity.  \nThe Group sponsors the formation of structured entities and interacts with structured entities sponsored by third parties \nfor a variety of reasons, including allowing clients to hold investments in separate legal entities, allowing clients to invest \njointly in alternative assets, for asset securitization transactions, and for buying or selling credit protection. \nWhen assessing whether to consolidate an entity, the Group evaluates a range of control factors, namely: \n– Purpose and design of the entity \n– Relevant activities and how these are determined \n– Whether the Group’s rights result in the ability to direct the relevant activities \n– Whether the Group has exposure or rights to variable returns  \n– Whether the Group has the ability to use its power to affect the amount of its returns  \nWhere voting rights are relevant, the Group is deemed to have control where it holds, directly or indirectly, more than half \nof the voting rights over an entity unless there is evidence that another investor has the practical ability to unilaterally \ndirect the relevant activities.  \nPotential voting rights that are deemed to be substantive are also considered when assessing control.  \nLikewise, the Group also assesses existence of control where it does not control the majority of the voting power but has \nthe practical ability to unilaterally direct the relevant activities. This may arise in circumstances where the size and \ndispersion of holdings of the shareholders give the Group the power to direct the activities of the investee. \nAssociates  \nInvestments in associates are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. An associate is an entity in which the \nGroup has significant influence, but not a controlling interest, over the operating and financial management policy \ndecisions of the entity. Significant influence is generally presumed when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the \nvoting rights. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are \nconsidered in assessing whether the Group has significant influence. Among the other factors that are considered in \ndetermining whether the Group has significant influence are representation on the board of directors (supervisory board \nin the case of German stock corporations) and material intercompany transactions. The existence of these factors could \nrequire the application of the equity method of accounting for a particular investment even though the Group’s investment \nis less than 20% of the voting stock. \nUnder the equity method of accounting, the Group’s investments in associates and jointly controlled entities are initially \nrecorded at cost including any directly related transaction costs incurred in acquiring the associate, and subsequently \nincreased (or decreased) to reflect both the Group’s pro-rata share of the post-acquisition net income (or loss) of the \nassociate or jointly controlled entity and other movements included directly in the equity of the associate or jointly \ncontrolled entity. The Group’s share of the results of associates is adjusted to conform to the accounting policies of the \nGroup and is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income as Net income (loss) from equity method investments. \nIf there is objective evidence of impairment, an impairment test is performed by comparing the investment’s recoverable \namount, which is the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs to sell, with its carrying amount. \n \n \n"}

Various \nentities in the Group use a different functional currency, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which \nthe entity operates. \nAn entity records foreign currency revenues, expenses, gains and losses in its functional currency using the exchange rates \nprevailing at the dates of recognition. \nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency are translated at the \nperiod end closing rate. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the translation and settlement of these items \nare recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income as net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value \nthrough profit or loss in order to align the translation amounts with those recognized from foreign currency related \ntransactions (derivatives) which hedge these monetary assets and liabilities. \nNon-monetary items that are measured at historical cost are translated using the historical exchange rate at the date of \nthe transaction. Translation differences on non-monetary items which are held at fair value through profit or loss are \nrecognized in profit or loss.  \nFor purposes of translation into the presentation currency, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the \nperiod end closing rate and items of income and expense are translated into euros at the rates prevailing on the dates of \nthe transactions, or average rates of exchange where these approximate actual rates. The exchange differences arising on \nthe translation of a foreign operation are included in other comprehensive income. For foreign operations that are \nsubsidiaries, the amount of exchange differences attributable to any noncontrolling interests is recognized in \nnoncontrolling interests. \nUpon disposal of a foreign subsidiary and associate (which results in loss of control or significant influence over that \noperation) the total cumulative exchange differences recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit \nor loss. \nUpon partial disposal of a foreign operation that is a subsidiary and which does not result in loss of control, the \nproportionate share of cumulative exchange differences is reclassified from other comprehensive income to \nnoncontrolling interests as this is deemed a transaction with equity holders. For a partial disposal of an associate which \ndoes not result in a loss of significant influence, the proportionate share of cumulative exchange differences is reclassified \nfrom other comprehensive income to profit or loss. \nInterest, commissions and fees  \nNet interest income – Interest income and expense from all interest-bearing assets and liabilities is recognized as net \ninterest income using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate (EIR) is a method of calculating the \namortized cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or expense over the relevant \nperiod using the estimated future cash flows. \nThe estimated future cash flows used in the EIR calculation include those determined by all of the contractual terms of \nthe asset or liability, all fees (including commissions) that are considered to be integral to the effective interest rate, direct \nand incremental transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. However, if the financial instrument is carried at \nfair value through profit or loss, any associated fees are recognized in trading income when the instrument is initially \nrecognized, provided there are no significant unobservable inputs used in determining its fair value.  \nIf a financial asset is credit-impaired, interest revenue is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortized \ncost amount. The amortized cost amount of a financial asset is the gross carrying amount of a financial asset after adjusting \nfor any impairment allowance. For assets which are initially recognized as purchased or credit-impaired, interest revenue \nis calculated through the use of a credit-adjusted effective interest rate which takes into consideration expected credit \nlosses.  \nThe Group presents negative interest paid on interest-bearing assets as interest expense, and interest revenue received \nfrom interest-bearing liabilities as interest income.  \nThe Group presents interest income and expense calculated using the EIR method separately in the Group’s consolidated \nstatement of income. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 428, "text": " \n \n396  \nDeutsche Bank  \nNotes to the consolidated financial statements \nAnnual Report 2024 \n01 – Material accounting policies and critical accounting estimates \nCommissions and fee income –The Group applies the IFRS 15, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” five-step revenue \nrecognition model to the recognition of Commissions and Fee Income, under which income must be recognized when \ncontrol of goods and services is transferred, hence the contractual performance obligations to the customer have been \nsatisfied.  \nAccordingly, after a contract with a customer has been identified in the first step, the second step is to identify the \nperformance obligation – or a series of distinct performance obligations – provided to the customer. The Group must \nexamine whether the service is capable of being distinct and is actually distinct within the context of the contract. A \npromised service is distinct if the customer can benefit from the service either on its own or together with other resources \nthat are readily available to the customer, and the promise to transfer the service to the customer is separately identifiable \nfrom other promises in the contract. The amount of income is measured on the basis of the contractually agreed \ntransaction price for the performance obligation defined in the contract. If a contract includes a variable consideration, \nthe Group estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised \ngoods or services to a customer. Income is recognized in profit and loss when the identified performance obligation has \nbeen satisfied. The Group does not present information about its remaining performance obligations if it is part of a \ncontract that has an original expected duration of one year or less.  \nThe Group determines the stand-alone selling price at contract inception of a distinct service underlying each performance \nobligation in the contract and allocates the transaction price in proportion to those stand-alone selling prices. The stand-\nalone selling price is the price at which Deutsche Bank would sell a promised service separately to a customer on an \nunbundled basis. The best evidence of a stand-alone selling price is the observable price of a service when the Group sells \nthat service separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. If the Group does not sell the service to a \ncustomer separately, it estimates the stand-alone selling price at an amount using a suitable method, for example, in loan \nsyndication transactions the Group applies the requirements for recognition of trade day profit and considers the price at \nwhich other market participants provide the same service on an unbundled basis. As such when estimating a stand-alone \nselling price, the Group considers all information (including market conditions) that is reasonably available to it. In doing \nso, the Group maximizes the use of observable inputs and applies estimation methods consistently in similar \ncircumstances. \nThe Group provides asset management services that give rise to asset management and performance fees and constitute \na single performance obligation. The asset management and performance fee components are variable considerations \nsuch that at each reporting date the Group estimates the fee amount to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring \nthe promised services to the customer. The benefits arising from the asset management services are simultaneously \nreceived and consumed by the customer over time. The Group recognizes revenue over time by measuring the progress \ntowards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation, subject to the removal of any uncertainty as to whether it \nis highly probable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized would occur or not. For the \nmanagement fee component this is the end of the monthly or quarterly service period. For performance fees this date is \nwhen any uncertainty related to the performance component has been fully removed. \nLoan commitment fees related to commitments that are accounted for off balance sheet are recognized in commissions \nand fee income over the life of the commitment if it is unlikely that the Group will enter into a specific lending arrangement. \nIf it is probable that the Group will enter into a specific lending arrangement, the loan commitment fee is deferred until \nthe origination of a loan and recognized as an adjustment to the loan’s effective interest rate. \nCommissions and Fee Income predominantly earned from services that are received and consumed by the customer over \ntime: Administration, assets under management, foreign commercial business, loan processing and guarantees sundry \nother customer services. The Group recognizes revenue from these services over time by measuring the progress towards \ncomplete satisfaction of that performance obligation, subject to the removal of any uncertainty as to whether it is highly \nprobable that a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized would occur or not.  \nCommissions and Fee Income predominantly earned from providing services at a point in time or transaction-type services \ninclude other securities, underwriting and advisory fees, brokerage fees, local payments, foreign currency/exchange \nbusiness and intermediary fees.  \nExpenses that are directly related and incremental to the generation of Commissions and Fee Income are presented net in \nCommissions and Fee Income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. This includes income and associated expense \nwhere the Group contractually owns the performance obligation (i.e. as Principal) in relation to the service that gives rise \nto the revenue and associated expense. In contrast, it does not include situations where the Group does not contractually \nown the performance obligation and is acting as agent.

There are three \nbusiness models available: \n– Hold to Collect - Financial assets held with the objective to collect contractual cash flows. They are subsequently \nmeasured at amortized cost and are recorded in multiple lines on the Group’s consolidated balance sheet. \n– Hold to Collect and Sell - Financial assets held with the objective of both collecting contractual cash flows and selling \nfinancial assets. They are recorded as Financial assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income on the \nGroup’s consolidated balance sheet. \n– Other - Financial assets that do not meet the criteria of either “Hold to Collect” or “Hold to Collect and Sell”. They are \nrecorded as Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss on the Group’s consolidated balance sheet. \nThe assessment of business model requires judgment based on facts and circumstances upon initial recognition. As part \nof this assessment, the Group considers quantitative factors (e.g., the expected frequency and volume of sales) and \nqualitative factors such as how the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business \nmodel are evaluated and reported to the Group’s key management personnel. In addition to taking into consideration the \nrisks that affect the performance of the business model and the financial assets held within that business model, in \nparticular, the way in which those market and credit risks are managed; and how managers of the business are \ncompensated (e.g., whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash \nflows collected). This assessment results in an asset being classified in either a Hold to Collect, Hold to Collect and Sell or \nOther business model.  \nIf the Group holds a financial asset either in a Hold to Collect or a Hold to Collect and Sell business model, then an \nassessment at initial recognition to determine whether the contractual cash flows of the financial asset are Solely \nPayments of Principal and Interest on the principal amount outstanding is required to determine the financial asset \nclassification. Contractual cash flows, that are SPPI on the principal amount outstanding, are consistent with a basic \nlending arrangement. Interest in a basic lending arrangement is consideration for the time value of money and the credit \nrisk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time. It can also include consideration \nfor other basic lending risks (e.g., liquidity risk) and costs (e.g., administrative costs) associated with holding the financial \nasset for a particular period of time; and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where cash \nflows can change over time due to contingent events, such as terms where the margin on a loan adjusts depending on the \nperformance of the borrower on certain contractual ESG metrics, the contingent event and cash flows are assessed to \ndetermine if the instrument cash flows are SPPI. The nature of the contingent event and the size of the possible change in \ncash flows are taken into account in this assessment on an absolute and relative basis compared to the overall coupon. \nAdditionally, as part of the SPPI assessment where the lending is non-recourse in nature then further assessment is made \nto determine if the cash flows are consistent with SPPI which is dependent on the nature of the underlyings, the level of \nsubordination and the contractual cash flows of the instrument held. The Group originates and purchases debt instruments \nfrom entities issuing multiple tranches of debt. Where these instruments meet the definition of a contractually linked \ninstruments then further analysis is performed on the cash flows and credit risk exposure of the instrument held as well as \nthe underlying collateral held at purchase and can be held in the future. \nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss \nFinancial assets are classified at fair value through profit or loss if they are held in the Other business model because they \nare either held for trading or because they do not meet the criteria for Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell. In \naddition, it includes financial assets that meet the criteria for Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell business model, \nbut the financial asset fails SPPI or where the Group designated the financial assets under the fair value option. \nFinancial assets classified as Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with realized and \nunrealized gains and losses included in Net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. \nInterest on interest earning assets such as trading loans and debt securities and dividends on equity instruments are \npresented in Interest and Similar Income.  \nThe Group applies trade date accounting to financial assets classified at fair value through profit or loss. \n \n \n"}

Trading assets include debt and equity securities, derivatives held for trading purposes, and trading loans. \nThis also includes loan commitments that are allocated to the Other business model and that are presented as derivatives \nheld for trading. \nNon-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit and loss –The Group assigns any non-trading financial \nasset that does not fall into the Hold to Collect nor Hold to Collect and Sell business models into the Other business model \nand classifies them as Non-Trading Financial Assets mandatory at Fair Value through Profit and Loss. This includes \npredominately reverse repurchase agreements which are managed on a fair value basis. Additionally, any financial asset \nthat falls into the Hold to Collect or Hold to Collect and Sell business models for which the contractual cash flow \ncharacteristics are not SPPI is classified by the Group as Non-Trading Financial Assets Mandatory at Fair Value through \nProfit and Loss. \nFinancial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss – Certain financial assets that would otherwise be measured \nsubsequently at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, may be designated at Fair Value \nthrough Profit or Loss if the designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency. \nThe Group allows the fair value option to be designated only for those financial instruments for which a reliable estimate \nof fair value can be obtained. \nFinancial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income \nA financial asset shall be classified and measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (“FVOCI”), if the \nfinancial asset is held in a Hold to Collect and Sell business model and the contractual cash flows are SPPI, unless \ndesignated under the fair value option.  \nThe amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recorded in net interest income. Realized gains and losses \nare reported in net gains (losses) on financial assets at FVOCI. Generally, the weighted-average cost method is used to \ndetermine the cost of FVOCI financial assets. \nThe Group applies trade date accounting to financial assets classified at FVOCI. \nIt is possible to designate non-trading equity instruments as FVOCI. However, this category is expected to have limited \nusage by the Group and has not been used to date. \nFinancial assets at amortized cost \nA financial asset is classified and subsequently measured at amortized cost if the financial asset is held in a Hold to Collect \nbusiness model and the contractual cash flows are SPPI.  \nUnder this measurement category, the financial asset is measured at fair value at initial recognition. Subsequently the \ncarrying amount is reduced for principal payments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization using the effective interest \nmethod. The financial asset is assessed for impairment under the IFRS 9 expected credit loss model where provisions are \nrecognized based on expectations of potential credit losses. The Group’s impairment of financial instruments policy is \ndescribed further in the section “Impairment of Loans and Provision for Off-Balance Sheet Positions (IFRS 9)”. The Group \napplies settlement date accounting to financial assets measured at amortized cost. \nFinancial Assets at amortized cost include predominately Loans at amortized cost, Central bank funds sold and securities \npurchased under resale agreements, Securities borrowed and certain receivables presented in Other Assets. \n \n \n"}

The modified financial asset will continue to accrue \ninterest at its original EIR. When a modification results in derecognition the original instrument is derecognized and the \nnew instrument recognized at fair value. \nNon-credit related or commercial renegotiations where an obligor has not experienced a significant increase in credit risk \nsince origination and has a readily exercisable right to early terminate the financial asset results in derecognition of the \noriginal agreement and recognition of a new financial asset based on the newly negotiated commercial terms.  \nFor credit related modifications (i.e. those modifications due to significant increase in credit risk since inception) or those \nwhere the obligor does not have the readily exercisable right to early terminate, the Group assesses whether the modified \nterms result in the financial asset being significantly modified and therefore derecognized. This assessment includes a \nquantitative assessment of the impact of the change in cash flows from the modification of contractual terms and \nadditionally, where necessary, a qualitative assessment of the impact of the change in the contractual terms. Where these \nmodifications are not concluded to be significant, the financial asset is not derecognized and is accounted for as a \nmodification as described above.  \nIf the changes are concluded to be significant, the old instrument is derecognized and a new instrument recognized.

However, if following a \nmodification that results in a derecognition of the original financial asset, there is evidence that the new financial asset is \ncredit-impaired on initial recognition; then the new financial asset should be recognized as an originated credit-impaired \nfinancial asset and initially classified in Stage 3 (refer to section “Impairment of Loans and Provision for Off-Balance Sheet \nPositions” below). \nWhen the terms of a financial liability are renegotiated or modified then the Group assesses whether the modified terms \nresult in the financial liability being significantly modified and therefore derecognized.

Under IFRS 9 they are \ncarried at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in net gains (losses) on financial assets and \nliabilities at fair value through profit or loss. For financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss the fair \nvalue movements attributable to the Group’s own credit component for fair value movements is recognized in Other \nComprehensive Income. \nThe Group applies trade date accounting to financial liabilities classified at fair value through profit or loss. \nInterest on interest paying liabilities are presented in interest expense for financial instruments at fair value through profit \nor loss. \nTrading liabilities - Financial liabilities that arise from debt issued are classified as held for trading if they have been \noriginated or incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing them in the near term. Trading liabilities consist primarily \nof derivative liabilities (including certain loan commitments) and short positions. This also includes loan commitments \nwhere the resulting loan upon funding is allocated to the other business model such that the undrawn loan commitment \nis classified as derivatives held for trading. \nFinancial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss - Certain financial liabilities that do not meet the definition \nof trading liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value option. To be designated at fair \nvalue through profit or loss, financial liabilities must meet one of the following criteria: (1) the designation eliminates or \nsignificantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency; (2) a group of financial liabilities is managed and its \nperformance is evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy; \nor (3) the instrument contains one or more embedded derivatives unless: (a) the embedded derivative does not significantly \nmodify the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract; or (b) it is clear with little or no analysis that \nseparation is prohibited. In addition, the Group allows the fair value option to be designated only for those financial \ninstruments for which a reliable estimate of fair value can be obtained. Financial liabilities which are designated at fair \nvalue through profit or loss, under the fair value option, include repurchase agreements, loan commitments and structured \nnote liabilities. \nInvestment contracts - All of the Group’s investment contracts are unit-linked contracts that match specific assets held \nby the Group. The contracts oblige the Group to use these assets to settle investment contract liabilities. They do not \ncontain significant insurance risk or discretionary participation features. The contract liabilities are determined using \ncurrent unit prices multiplied by the number of units attributed to the contract holders as of the balance sheet date. As \nthis amount represents fair value, the liabilities have been classified as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or \nloss. Deposits collected under investment contracts are accounted for as an adjustment to the investment contract \nliabilities. Investment income attributable to investment contracts is included in the consolidated statement of Income. \nInvestment contract claims reflect the excess of amounts paid over the account balance released. Investment contract \npolicyholders are charged fees for policy administration, investment management, surrenders or other contract services.  \nEmbedded derivatives \nSome hybrid financial liability contracts contain both a derivative and a non-derivative component. In such cases, the \nderivative component is termed an embedded derivative, with the non-derivative component representing the host \nfinancial liability contract. If the economic characteristics and risks of embedded derivatives are not closely related to \nthose of the host financial liability contract and the hybrid financial liability contract itself is not carried at fair value \nthrough profit or loss, the embedded derivative is bifurcated and reported at fair value, with gains and losses recognized \nin net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. The host financial liability contract will \ncontinue to be accounted for in accordance with the appropriate accounting standard. The carrying amount of an \nembedded derivative is reported in the same Consolidated balance sheet line item as the host financial liability contract. \nCertain hybrid financial liability instruments have been designated at fair value through profit or loss using the fair value \noption.  \n"}

Repurchases of issued debt in the \nmarket are treated as extinguishments and any related gain or loss is recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \nA subsequent sale of own bonds in the market is treated as a reissuance of debt. The Group applies settlement date \naccounting to financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. \nOffsetting of financial instruments  \nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset, with the net amount presented in the Consolidated balance sheet, only if the \nGroup holds a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a \nnet basis or to realize an asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legal right to set off the recognized amounts \nmust be enforceable in both the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of both \nthe Group and its counterparty. In all other situations they are presented gross. When financial assets and financial \nliabilities are offset in the Consolidated balance sheet, the associated income and expense items will also be offset in the \nConsolidated Statement of Income, unless specifically prohibited by an applicable accounting standard. \nThe majority of the offsetting applied by the Group relates to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. For further \ninformation please refer to Note 17 “Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”. \nDetermination of fair value  \nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an arm’s length \ntransaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value of instruments that are quoted in active \nmarkets is determined using the quoted prices where they represent those at which regularly and recently occurring \ntransactions take place.  \nThe Group measures certain portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of their net risk exposures \nwhen the following criteria are met: \n– The group of financial assets and liabilities is managed on the basis of its net exposure to a particular market risk (or \nrisks) or to the credit risk of a particular counterparty, in accordance with a documented risk management strategy, \n– The fair values are provided to key management personnel, and \n– The financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss. \nThis portfolio valuation approach is consistent with how the Group manages its net exposures to market and counterparty \ncredit risks. \nCritical accounting estimates – The Group uses valuation techniques to establish the fair value of instruments where prices \nquoted in active markets are not available. Therefore, where possible, parameter inputs to the valuation techniques are \nbased on observable data derived from prices of relevant instruments traded in an active market. These valuation \ntechniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which will depend on the price \ntransparency for the instrument or market and the instrument’s complexity.  \nIn reaching estimates of fair value management judgment needs to be exercised. The areas requiring significant \nmanagement judgment are identified, documented and reported to senior management as part of the valuation control \nprocess and the standard monthly reporting cycle. The specialist model validation and valuation control groups focus \nattention on the areas of subjectivity and judgment.  \nThe level of management judgment required in establishing fair value of financial instruments for which there is a quoted \nprice in an active market is usually minimal. Similarly, there is little subjectivity or judgment required for instruments valued \nusing valuation models which are standard across the industry and where all parameter inputs are quoted in active markets. \n \n \n"}

In particular, where data are obtained from infrequent market transactions then extrapolation and \ninterpolation techniques must be applied. Where no market data are available for a particular instrument then pricing \ninputs are determined by assessing other relevant sources of information such as historical data, fundamental analysis of \nthe economics of the transaction and proxy information from similar transactions and making appropriate adjustment to \nreflect the actual instrument being valued and current market conditions. Where different valuation techniques indicate a \nrange of possible fair values for an instrument then management has to decide what point within the range of estimates \nappropriately represents the fair value. Further, some valuation adjustments may require the exercise of management \njudgment to achieve fair value.  \nFinancial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are required to be disclosed according to the inputs to the valuation \nmethod that are used to determine their fair value. Specifically, segmentation is required between those valued using \nquoted market prices in an active market (level 1), valuation techniques based on observable parameters (level 2) and \nvaluation techniques using significant unobservable parameters (level 3). Management judgment is required in \ndetermining the category to which certain instruments should be allocated. This specifically arises when the valuation is \ndetermined by a number of parameters, some of which are observable and others are not. Further, the classification of an \ninstrument can change over time to reflect changes in market liquidity and therefore price transparency. \nThe Group provides a sensitivity analysis of the impact upon the level 3 financial instruments of using a reasonably possible \nalternative for the unobservable parameter. The determination of reasonably possible alternatives requires significant \nmanagement judgment. \nFor financial instruments measured at amortized cost (which include loans, deposits and short and long term debt issued) \nthe Group discloses the fair value. Generally, there is limited or no trading activity in these instruments and therefore the \nfair value determination requires significant management judgment. \nFor further discussion of the valuation methods and controls and quantitative disclosures with respect to the \ndetermination of fair value, please refer to Note 13 “Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value” and Note 14 “Fair Value of \nFinancial Instruments not carried at Fair Value”. \nRecognition of trade date profit  \nTrade date profit is recognized if the fair value of the financial instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss is \nobtained from a quoted market price in an active market, or otherwise evidenced by comparison to other observable \ncurrent market transactions or based on a valuation technique incorporating observable market data. If there are \nsignificant unobservable inputs used in the valuation technique, the financial instrument is recognized at the transaction \nprice and any profit implied from the valuation technique at trade date is deferred.  \nUsing systematic methods, the deferred amount is recognized over the period between trade date and the date when the \nmarket is expected to become observable, or over the life of the trade (whichever is shorter). Such methodology is used \nbecause it reflects the changing economic and risk profile of the instrument as the market develops or as the instrument \nitself progresses to maturity. Any remaining trade date deferred profit is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of \nIncome when the transaction becomes observable.  \nCritical Accounting Estimates – Management judgment is required in determining whether there exist significant \nunobservable inputs in the valuation technique of the underlying financial instrument (refer to section “Determination of \nFair Value” for management judgment required in establishing fair value of financial instruments). Once deferred, the \ndecision to subsequently recognize the trade date profit requires a careful assessment of the then current facts and \ncircumstances supporting observability of parameters and/or risk mitigation. \nDerivatives and hedge accounting \nDerivatives are used to manage exposures to interest rate, foreign currency, credit and other market price risks, including \nexposures arising from forecast transactions. All freestanding contracts that are considered derivatives for accounting \npurposes are carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheet regardless of whether they are held for trading or \nnon-trading purposes. \nThe changes in fair value on derivatives held for trading are included in net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at \nfair value through profit or loss. \n"}

The Group decided to exercise this accounting policy choice and did not adopt IFRS 9 hedge \naccounting as of January 1, 2018. The Group applies fair value hedge accounting for portfolio hedges of interest rate risk \n(fair value macro hedges) in accordance with the EU carve-out version of IAS 39. Under the EU IAS 39 carve-out, fair value \nmacro hedge accounting may be applied to core deposits and hedge ineffectiveness for all fair value macro hedge \naccounting applications is only recognized when the revised estimate of the amount of cash flows in scheduled time \nbuckets falls below the original designated amount of that bucket and is not recognized when the revised amount of cash \nflows in scheduled time buckets is more than the original designated amount.  \nFor accounting purposes, the Group applies the following types of hedges: \n– For hedges of changes in fair value, the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset, liability or unrecognized firm \ncommitment, or a portion thereof, attributable to the risk being hedged, are recognized in the Consolidated Statement \nof Income along with changes in the entire fair value of the derivative. When hedging interest rate risk, any interest \naccrued or paid on both the derivative and the hedged item is reported in interest income or expense and the unrealized \ngains and losses from the hedge accounting fair value adjustments are reported in other revenue. Hedge ineffectiveness \nis reported in other revenue and is measured as the net effect of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument \nand changes in the fair value of the hedged item arising from changes in the market rate or price related to the risk(s) \nbeing hedged. \nIf a fair value hedge of a debt instrument is discontinued prior to the instrument’s maturity because the derivative is \nterminated or the relationship is de-designated, any remaining interest rate-related fair value adjustments made to the \ncarrying amount of the debt instrument (basis adjustments) are amortized to interest income or expense over the \nremaining term of the original hedging relationship. For other types of fair value adjustments and whenever a fair value \nhedged asset or liability is sold or otherwise derecognized, any basis adjustments are included in the calculation of the \ngain or loss on derecognition. \n– For hedges of variability in future cash flows, there is no change to the accounting for the hedged item and the \nderivative is carried at fair value, with changes in value reported initially in other comprehensive income to the extent \nthe hedge is effective. These amounts initially recorded in other comprehensive income are subsequently reclassified \ninto the Consolidated Statement of Income in the same periods during which the forecast transaction affects the \nConsolidated Statement of Income. Thus, for hedges of interest rate risk, the amounts are amortized into interest \nincome or expense at the same time as the interest is accrued on the hedged transaction. \nHedge ineffectiveness is recorded in other income and is measured as changes in the excess (if any) in the absolute \ncumulative change in fair value of the actual hedging derivative over the absolute cumulative change in the fair value \nof the hypothetically perfect hedge. \nWhen hedges of variability in cash flows attributable to interest rate risk are discontinued, amounts remaining in \naccumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to interest income or expense over the remaining life of the \noriginal hedge relationship, unless the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur in which case the amount will \nbe reclassified into other income immediately. When hedges of variability in cash flows attributable to other risks are \ndiscontinued, the related amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified into either the same \nConsolidated Statement of Income caption and period as profit or loss from the forecast transaction, or into other \nincome when the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur. \n– For hedges of the translation adjustments resulting from translating the functional currency financial statements of \nforeign operations (hedges of net investments in foreign operations) into the functional currency of the parent, the \nportion of the change in fair value of the derivative due to changes in the spot foreign exchange rates is recorded as a \nforeign currency translation adjustment in other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective; the \nremainder is recorded as other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \nChanges in fair value of the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are subsequently recognized \nin profit or loss on disposal of the foreign operations.  \nHedging derivatives are reported as other assets and other liabilities. In the event that a derivative is subsequently de-\ndesignated from a hedging relationship, it is transferred to financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. \n"}

For purposes of the \nimpairment policy below, these instruments are referred to as (“Financial Assets”)  \nThe determination of impairment losses under IFRS 9 uses an expected credit loss (“ECL”) model, where allowances are \ntaken upon initial recognition of the Financial Asset, based on expectations of potential credit losses at the time of initial \nrecognition. \nStaged approach to the determination of expected credit losses \nIFRS 9 states a three-stage approach to impairment for Financial Assets that are not credit-impaired at the date of \norigination or purchase. This approach is summarized as follows: \n– Stage 1: The Group recognizes a credit loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses for all \nFinancial Assets. This represents the portion of lifetime expected credit losses from default events that are expected \nwithin 12 months of the reporting date, assuming that credit risk has not increased significantly after initial recognition. \n– Stage 2: The Group recognizes a credit loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses for those \nFinancial Assets which are considered to have experienced a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. \nThis requires the determination of the ECL based on lifetime probability of default, lifetime loss given default and \nlifetime exposure at default that represents the probability of default occurring over the remaining lifetime of the \nFinancial Asset. Allowance for credit losses are higher in this stage because of an increase in credit risk since origination \nor purchase and the impact of a longer time horizon being considered compared to 12 months in Stage 1. \n– Stage 3: The Group recognizes a loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, reflecting a \nProbability of Default of 100%, via the expected recoverable cash flows for the asset, for those Financial Assets that are \ncredit-impaired. The Group’s definition of default is aligned with the regulatory definition of default. Financial Assets \nthat are credit-impaired upon initial recognition are categorized within Stage 3 with a carrying value already reflecting \nthe lifetime expected credit losses. The accounting treatment for these purchased or originated credit-impaired \n(“POCI”) assets is discussed further below. \nECL are calculated using three main parameters: probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at \ndefault (EAD). These parameters are generally derived from internally developed statistical models combined with \nhistorical, current and forward-looking information, including macro-economic data. The 12-month and lifetime PD \nrepresent the expected point-in-time probability of a default over the next 12 months and remaining expected lifetime of \nthe financial instrument, respectively, based on conditions existing at the balance sheet date and future economic \nconditions that affect credit risk. The LGD represents expected loss conditional on default, incorporating the mitigating \neffect of collateral, its expected value when realized and the time value of money. The EAD represents the expected \nexposure at default, factoring in the repayment of principal and interest from the balance sheet date to the default event \ntogether with any expected drawdown of a facility. \nForward-Looking Information is incorporated into the measurement of the Group Allowance for Credit Losses in terms of \nadjustments to multi-year PD curves based on macro-economic forecasts. \nThe Group’s ECL model is used to calculate the allowance for credit losses for all financial assets in Stage 1 and Stage 2, \nas well as for Stage 3 in the homogeneous portfolio (i.e. retail and small business loans with similar credit risk \ncharacteristics). For financial assets in the bank’s non-homogeneous portfolio in Stage 3 and for POCI assets, the allowance \nfor credit losses is determined individually by credit officers. \nSignificant increase in credit risk  \nWhen determining whether the credit risk (i.e., risk of default) of a Financial Asset has increased significantly since initial \nrecognition, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost \nor effort. This includes quantitative and qualitative information based on the Group’s historical experience, credit risk \nassessment and forward-looking information (including macro-economic factors).

These include obligors being added to a \ncredit watchlist, being mandatorily transferred to workout status, payments being 30 days or more past due or in \nforbearance. \nThese indicators are discussed further in section “IFRS 9 Impairment Approach” in the Risk Report. \nCredit-impaired financial assets in Stage 3 \nThe Group has aligned its definition of credit-impaired under IFRS 9 to when a Financial Asset has defaulted for regulatory \npurposes, according to the Capital Requirements Regulation under Art. 178. \nThe determination of whether a Financial Asset is credit-impaired and therefore in Stage 3 focusses exclusively on default \nrisk, without taking into consideration the effects of credit risk mitigants such as collateral or guarantees. Specifically, a \nFinancial Asset is credit-impaired and in Stage 3 when: \n– The Group considers the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Group. Determination may include \nforbearance actions, where a concession has been granted to the borrower or economic or legal reasons that are \nqualitative indicators of credit-impairment; or \n– Contractual payments of either principal or interest by the obligor are past due by more than 90 days. \nFor Financial Assets considered to be credit-impaired, the ECL allowance covers the amount of loss the Group is expected \nto suffer. The estimation of ECLs is undertaken on a case-by-case basis for non-homogeneous portfolios, or by applying \nportfolio based parameters to individual Financial Assets in these portfolios via the Group’s ECL model for homogeneous \nportfolios. This estimate includes the use of discounted cash flows that are adjusted for scenarios.  \nForecasts of future economic conditions when calculating ECLs are considered. The lifetime expected losses are estimated \nbased on the probability-weighted present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the \nGroup under the contract; and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive. \nA Financial Asset can be classified as credit-impaired in Stage 3 but without an allowance for credit losses (i.e., no \nimpairment loss is expected). This may be due to the value of collateral. The Group’s engine based ECL calculation is \nconducted on a monthly basis, whereas the case-by-case assessment of ECL in Stage 3 for non-homogeneous portfolio \nhas to be performed at least on a quarterly basis. \nPurchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets in Stage 3 \nA Financial Asset is considered purchased or originated credit-impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment at the \ntime of initial recognition. Such credit-impaired Financial Assets are termed POCI Financial Assets. POCI Financial Assets \nare measured to reflect lifetime expected credit losses, and all subsequent changes in lifetime expected credit losses, \nwhether positive or negative, are recognized in the income statement as a component of the provision for credit losses. \nPOCI Financial Assets can only be classified in Stage 3 over the life of the Financial Asset. \nWrite-offs \nThe Group reduces the gross carrying amount of a Financial Asset when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. \nWrite-offs can relate to a Financial Asset in its entirety, or to a portion of it, and constitute a derecognition event. The \nGroup considers all relevant information in making this determination, including but not limited to: \n– Foreclosure actions taken by the Group which have not been successful or have a high probability of not being \nsuccessful \n– Collateral liquidation which has not, or will not lead to further considerable recoveries \n– Situations where no further recoveries are reasonably expected \nWrite-offs can take place before legal actions against the borrower to recover the debt have been concluded, and a write-\noff does not involve the Group forfeiting its legal right to recover the debt. \n"}

The CIR is deemed to be an \nappropriate approximation, as the interest rate is consistently used in the ECL model, interest recognition and for \ndiscounting of the ECL. \nCollateral for financial assets considered in the impairment analysis \nIFRS 9 requires cash flows expected from collateral and other credit enhancement to be reflected in the ECL calculation. \nThe following are key aspects with respect to collateral and guarantees: \n– Eligibility of collateral, i.e. which collateral should be considered in the ECL calculation; \n– Collateral evaluation, i.e. what collateral (liquidation) value should be used; and \n– Projection of the available collateral amount over the life of a transaction. \nThese concepts are outlined in more detail in section “IFRS 9 Impairment Approach” in the Risk Report.  \nCritical accounting estimates – The accounting estimates and judgments related to the impairment of Financial Assets is \na critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used can change from period to period and may \nsignificantly affect the Group’s results of operations.  \nIn assessing assets for impairments, management judgment is required, particularly in projecting forward looking \ninformation and scenarios in particular in circumstances of economic and financial uncertainty, when developments and \nchanges to expected cash flows can occur both with greater rapidity and less predictability. The actual amount of the \nfuture cash flows and their timing may differ from the estimates used by management and consequently may cause actual \nlosses to differ from reported allowances. \nFor those non-homogeneous loans in Stage 3 the determination of the impairment allowance often requires the use of \nconsiderable judgment concerning such matters as local economic conditions, the financial performance of the \ncounterparty and the value of any collateral held, for which there may not be a readily accessible market.  \nThe determination of the expected credit losses in Stages 1 and 2 and for homogeneous loans in Stage 3 is calculated \nusing the Group’s ECL model. The model incorporates numerous estimates and judgments. The Group performs a regular \nreview of the model and underlying data and assumptions. The probability of defaults, loss recovery rates and judgments \nconcerning ability of borrowers in foreign countries to transfer the foreign currency necessary to comply with debt \nrepayments, amongst other things, are incorporated into this review. Management judgement is required over the \nfollowing critical accounting estimates: \n– Forward-Looking Information: The identification of key macro-economic variables (MEVs) reflects a balance of \nquantitative and qualitative judgements. Statistical analysis, including for example, back-testing and model \nsensitivities, are performed to assess the explanatory power of MEVs, while expert input from credit officers ensures \nmanagement comfort in the overall model behavior. The final model parameterization is based on a review and \nchallenge of impacts in internal governance forums and an independent validation performed by the Model Risk \nManagement function. Furthermore, conceptual soundness of the estimation approach is ensured by model testing \nanalysis prepared as part of model changes and an ongoing monitoring framework in order for the ECL provision to \nreflect management’s best estimate in the calculation of expected credit losses. \n– Significant Increase in Credit Risk: In line with the section “IFRS 9 Impairment Approach” in the Risk Report, the Group \nuses rating-related indicators to determine whether a financial asset’s credit risk has significantly increased since \ninception. For financial assets in non-homogeneous portfolios the ratings are determined for every counterparty \nindividually based on credit officer’s expert judgement. For financial assets in the homogeneous portfolios (due to the \nlarge number of client relationships) the rating process is significantly automated with less judgement required by credit \nofficers on individual counterparties. For both homogeneous and non-homogenous portfolios the rating-related \nindicators to determine whether the credit risk for a financial asset has significantly increased are based on a model that \ncompares lifetime PDs at the reporting date with the lifetime PD expectations at the date of initial recognition and \nsubsequently applying a quantile approach to determine a threshold which defines the trigger point for a financial \nasset’s transition into Stage 2. The determination of the quantile to define Stage 2 thresholds are determined by subject \nmatter experts in the Group’s Risk function. This represents one of the key critical judgments in the Group’s IFRS 9 \nframework and is reviewed on an annual basis based on detailed stage-mover analyses, benchmarking with historical \nbehaviors and peer comparisons. \n \n \n"}

The LGDs are calibrated using the Group’s loss history built up over preceding decades, \nexperienced market prices of non-performing portfolios sold and expert judgement. In the case of less material \nportfolios, the empirical calibration of the LGD is partially supported by expert credit officer judgements, especially for \ndetermining the client cure rates as one of the key inputs. The LGD settings are validated on an annual basis and are \nregularly reviewed by the Group’s independent model validation process which is part of the Model Risk Management \nfunction. \n– Model adjustments: The Group regularly reviews key inputs into the ECL calculation and discusses potential model \nimprecision to assess the need for corrective measures in the form of overlays.

These types of transactions are accounted for as secured \nfinancing transactions. \nDerecognition of financial liabilities \nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. If an \nexisting financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of the \nexisting liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original \nliability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the \nConsolidated Statement of Income. \nCertain OTC derivative contracts and most exchange-traded futures and option contracts cleared through central clearing \ncounterparties and exchanges have payment or receipt of variation margin on a daily basis that represents legal or \neconomic settlement of the outstanding derivative’s present value. This results in derecognition of the associated \nderivative financial asset and financial liabilities. \nRepurchase and reverse repurchase agreements  \nSecurities purchased under resale agreements (“reverse repurchase agreements”) and securities sold under agreements to \nrepurchase (“repurchase agreements”) are treated as collateralized financings and are recognized initially at fair value, \nbeing the amount of cash disbursed and received, respectively.  \nThe Group allocates reverse repurchase portfolios that are managed on a fair value basis to the other business model under \nIFRS 9 and classifies them as “Non-trading financial assets mandatory at fair value through profit or loss”.  \nInterest earned on reverse repurchase agreements and interest incurred on repurchase agreements is reported as interest \nincome and interest expense, respectively. \n"}

In a securities \nloaned transaction, the Group generally receives either cash collateral, in an amount equal to or in excess of the market \nvalue of securities loaned, or securities.  \nThe securities borrowed are not themselves recognized in the financial statements. If they are sold to third parties, the \nobligation to return the securities is recorded as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss and any subsequent \ngain or loss is included in the Consolidated Statement of Income in net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair \nvalue through profit or loss. Securities lent to counterparties are also retained on the Consolidated balance sheet. \nThe Group records the amount of cash advanced or received as securities borrowed and securities loaned, respectively, in \nthe Consolidated balance sheet. \nFees received or paid are reported in interest income and interest expense, respectively. Securities lent to counterparties \nwhich are not derecognized from the Consolidated balance sheet and where the counterparty has the right by contract or \ncustom to sell or repledge the collateral are disclosed in Note 20 “Transfer of Financial Assets, Assets Pledged and \nReceived as Collateral”. \nGoodwill and other intangible assets  \nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates and represents the excess of the aggregate of the cost of \nan acquisition and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired at \nthe date of the acquisition. \nFor the purpose of calculating goodwill, fair values of acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are determined \nby reference to market values or by discounting expected future cash flows to present value. This discounting is either \nperformed using market rates or by using risk-free rates and risk-adjusted expected future cash flows. Any noncontrolling \ninterests in the acquiree are measured either at fair value or at the noncontrolling interests’ proportionate share of the \nacquiree’s identifiable net assets (this is determined for each business combination). \nGoodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalized and reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there \nare indications that impairment may have occurred. For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business \ncombination is allocated to cash-generating units (“CGUs”), which are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that \ngenerate cash inflows largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets and that are expected \nto benefit from the synergies of the combination and considering the business level at which goodwill is monitored for \ninternal management purposes. In identifying whether cash inflows from an asset (or a group of assets) are largely \nindependent of the cash inflows from other assets (or groups of assets) various factors are considered, including how \nmanagement monitors the entity’s operations or makes decisions about continuing or disposing of the entity’s assets and \noperations.  \nIf goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and an operation within that unit is disposed of, the attributable goodwill is \nincluded in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on its disposal. \nCorporate assets are allocated to a CGU when the allocation can be done on a reasonable and consistent basis. If this is \nnot possible, the individual CGU is tested without the corporate assets. They are then tested on the level of the minimum \ncollection of CGUs to which they can be allocated on a reasonable and consistent basis. \nIntangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal \nrights and their fair value can be measured reliably. Intangible assets that have a finite useful life are stated at cost less any \naccumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Customer-related intangible assets that have a finite \nuseful life are amortized over periods of between 1 and 20 years on a straight-line basis based on their expected useful \nlife. These assets are tested for impairment and their useful lives reaffirmed at least annually. \nCertain intangible assets have an indefinite useful life and hence are not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least \nannually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. \n \n \n"}

Capitalized costs are amortized using the straight-\nline method over the asset’s useful life which is deemed to be either three, five or ten years. Eligible costs include external \ndirect costs for materials and services, as well as payroll and payroll-related costs for employees directly associated with \nan internal-use software project. Overhead costs, as well as costs incurred during the research phase or after software is \nready for use, are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software costs are tested for impairment either annually if still under \ndevelopment or any time when there is an indication of impairment once the software is in use. \nCritical accounting estimates – The determination of the recoverable amount in the impairment assessment of non-\nfinancial assets requires estimates based on quoted market prices, prices of comparable businesses, present value or other \nvaluation techniques (such as the cost approach), or a combination thereof, necessitating management to make subjective \njudgments and assumptions. Because these estimates and assumptions could result in significant differences to the \namounts reported if underlying circumstances were to change, the Group considers these estimates to be critical.  \nThe quantitative disclosures are provided in Note 23 “Goodwill and other intangible assets”. \nProvisions  \nProvisions are recognized if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, if it is \nprobable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the \namount of the obligation.  \nThe amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation as \nof the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. \nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party \n(for example, because the obligation is covered by an insurance policy), an asset is recognized if it is virtually certain that \nreimbursement will be received. \nIf the Group has a contract that is onerous, the present obligation under the contract is recognized and measured as a \nprovision. An onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract \nexceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. \nCritical accounting estimates –The use of estimates is important in determining provisions for potential losses that may \narise from litigation and regulatory proceedings. The Group estimates and provides for potential losses that may arise out \nof litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be estimated, in accordance \nwith IAS 37, “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”. Significant judgment is required in making these \nestimates and the Group’s final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. \nContingencies in respect of legal matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not \npredictable with assurance. Significant judgment is required in assessing probability and making estimates in respect of \ncontingencies, and the Group’s final liability may ultimately be materially different. The Group’s total liability in respect of \nlitigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of \nprobable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, the Group’s experience and the \nexperience of others in similar cases, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. Predicting the outcome of the Group’s \nlitigation matters is inherently difficult, particularly in cases in which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages. \nSee Note 27 “Provisions” for further information on the uncertainties from the Group’s judicial, regulatory and arbitration \nproceedings. \nIncome taxes \nThe Group recognizes the current and deferred tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the \nconsolidated financial statements using the provisions of the respective jurisdictions’ tax laws.

Deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient \ntaxable profit will be available against which those unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary \ndifferences can be utilized. As an exception to the aforementioned requirements, an entity shall neither recognize nor \ndisclose information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period that the \nasset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted \nat the balance sheet date.  \nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset when (1) they arise from the same tax reporting entity or tax group of reporting \nentities, (2) the legally enforceable right to offset exists and (3) they are intended to be settled net or realized \nsimultaneously.  \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when the legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities \nexists and the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxing authority on either the \nsame tax reporting entity or tax group of reporting entities. \nDeferred tax liabilities are provided on taxable temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches \nand associates and interests in joint ventures except when the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is \ncontrolled by the Group and it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred income \ntax assets are provided on deductible temporary differences arising from such investments only to the extent that it is \nprobable that the differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and sufficient taxable income will be available against \nwhich those temporary differences can be utilized. \nDeferred tax related to fair value remeasurement of financial assets classified as FVTOCI, cash flow hedges and other \nitems, which are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income, is also credited or charged directly to other \ncomprehensive income and subsequently recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income once the underlying \ntransaction or event to which the deferred tax relates is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income. \nFor share-based payment transactions, the Group may receive a tax deduction related to the compensation paid in shares. \nThe amount deductible for tax purposes may differ from the cumulative compensation expense recorded. At any reporting \ndate, the Group must estimate the expected future tax deduction based on the current share price. The associated current \nand deferred tax consequences are recognized as income or expense in the consolidated statement of Income for the \nperiod. If the amount deductible, or expected to be deductible, for tax purposes exceeds the cumulative compensation \nexpense, the excess tax benefit is recognized directly in equity.  \nCritical accounting estimates – In determining the amount of deferred tax assets, the Group uses historical tax capacity \nand profitability information and, if relevant, forecasted operating results based upon approved business plans, including \na review of the eligible carry-forward periods, available tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. The \nanalysis of the historical tax capacity includes the determination as to whether a period of past profits or a history of recent \nlosses exists at the reporting date. The determination of a period of past profits or a history of recent losses is based on the \npre-tax results adjusted for permanent differences and typically covers the current and the two preceding financial years. \nEach quarter, the Group re-evaluates its estimate related to deferred tax assets.  \nThe Group believes that the accounting estimate related to the deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate \nbecause the underlying assumptions can change from period to period and requires significant management judgment. \nFor example, tax law changes, changes in the historical tax capacity or variances in future projected operating performance \ncould result in a change of the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset. If the Group was not able to realize all or part of its \nnet deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to its deferred tax assets would be charged to income tax expense or \ndirectly to equity in the period such determination was made. If the Group was to recognize previously unrecognized \ndeferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to its deferred tax asset would be credited to income tax expense or \ndirectly to equity in the period such determination was made. \nThe use of estimates is also important in determining provisions for potential losses that may arise from uncertain income \ntax positions. The Group estimates and provides for potential losses that may arise out of uncertain income tax positions, \nin accordance with IAS 12, “Income Taxes” and IFRIC 23, “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment”. Significant judgment \nis required in making these estimates and the Group’s final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. \nFor further information on the Group’s income taxes (including quantitative disclosures on recognized deferred tax assets) \nsee Note 34 “Income Taxes”. \n"}

At the date the Group obtains control of \nthe subsidiary, the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the consideration given, including any cash or non-\ncash consideration (equity instruments) transferred, any contingent consideration, any previously held equity interest in \nthe acquiree and liabilities incurred or assumed. The excess of the aggregate of the cost of an acquisition and any \nnoncontrolling interests in the acquiree over the Group’s share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is \nrecorded as goodwill. If the aggregate of the acquisition cost and any noncontrolling interests is below the fair value of \nthe identifiable net assets (negative goodwill), a gain is reported in other income. Acquisition-related costs are recognized \nas expenses in the period in which they are incurred. \nIn business combinations achieved in stages (“step acquisitions”), a previously held equity interest in the acquiree is \nremeasured to its acquisition-date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in profit or loss. Amounts \nrecognized in prior periods in other comprehensive income associated with the previously held investment would be \nrecognized on the same basis as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the previously held equity interest. \nNoncontrolling interests are shown in the consolidated balance sheet as a separate component of equity, which is distinct \nfrom the Group’s shareholders’ equity. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is separately disclosed on \nthe face of the Consolidated Statement of Income. Changes in the ownership interest in subsidiaries which do not result \nin a change of control are treated as transactions between equity holders and are reported in additional paid-in capital \n(“APIC”). \nNon-current assets held for sale  \nIndividual non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if they are available for immediate sale in \ntheir present condition subject only to the customary sales terms of such assets (and disposal groups) and their sale is \nconsidered highly probable. For a sale to be highly probable, management must be committed to a sales plan and be \nactively looking for a buyer and has no substantive regulatory approvals outstanding. Furthermore, the assets (and disposal \ngroups) must be actively marketed at a reasonable sales price in relation to their current fair value and the sale should be \nexpected to be completed within one year. Non-current non-financial assets (and disposal groups) which meet the criteria \nfor held for sale classification are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal and \nare presented within “Other assets” and “Other liabilities” in the balance sheet. Financial assets and liabilities meeting the \ncriteria continue to be measured in accordance with IFRS 9. The comparatives are not represented when non-current \nassets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale.  \nProperty and equipment  \nProperty and equipment includes own-use properties, leasehold improvements, furniture and equipment and software \n(operating systems only). Right-of-use assets are presented together with property and equipment on the Group’s \nconsolidated balance sheet. Own-use properties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated \nimpairment losses. Depreciation is generally recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of \nthe assets. The range of estimated useful lives is 25 to 50 years for property and 3 to 10 years for furniture and equipment \n(including initial improvements to purchased buildings). Leasehold improvements are capitalized and subsequently \ndepreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the term of the lease and the estimated useful life of the \nimprovement, which generally ranges from 3 to 25 years. Depreciation of property and equipment is included in general \nand administrative expenses. Maintenance and repairs are also charged to general and administrative expenses. Gains and \nlosses on disposals are included in other income. \nProperty and equipment are assessed for any indication of impairment at each quarterly reporting date. If such indication \nexists, the recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use, must be estimated \nand an impairment charge is recorded to the extent the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount. Value in use \nis the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset. After the recognition of impairment of \nan asset, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to reflect the asset’s revised carrying amount. If an \nimpairment is later reversed, the depreciation charge is adjusted prospectively. \nFinancial guarantees \nFinancial guarantee contracts are contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for \na loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payments when due in accordance with the terms of a debt \ninstrument. \n"}

Financial guarantees that the Group has not designated at fair value are initially recognized at fair value on the date \nthe guarantee is given. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group’s liabilities under such guarantees are measured at the \nhigher of the amount initially recognized, less cumulative amortization, and the best estimate of the expenditure required \nto settle any financial obligation as of the balance sheet date. These estimates are determined by management based on \nexperience with similar transactions and history of past losses. \nAny increase in the liability relating to guarantees is recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income in provision for \ncredit losses. \nFinancial guarantees purchased \nPurchased financial guarantees result in reimbursements under IAS 37 to the extent that the financial guarantee is entered \ninto to mitigate the credit exposure from debt instruments with HTC or HTC&S business models. This results in recognition \nof a reimbursement asset for subsequent increases in the expected credit losses, to the extent it is virtually certain that \nthe purchased financial guarantee will reimburse the Group for the loss incurred. Accordingly, when the credit risk of the \nborrower significantly deteriorates a reimbursement asset is recognized equal to the life-time expected credit losses and \nis presented as Other Assets in the Group’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The corresponding reimbursement gain is \nrecognized as a reduction in the Provision for credit losses in the Group’s Consolidated Statement of Income.  \nPurchased financial guarantees entered into to mitigate credit exposure from debt instruments allocated to HTC or HTC&S \nbusiness models may also be embedded in Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLO’s) issued by the Group. Such embedded \nguarantees are not accounted for separately as a reimbursement asset and are instead accounted as part of the CLO’s \nliability held at amortized cost. The Group regularly revises its estimated contractual redemption payment (including the \nbenefit of such embedded guarantees) from the CLO when the credit risk of a borrower covered by the embedded financial \nguarantee in the CLO significantly deteriorates. The revision is based on the life-time expected credit losses of the debt \ninstrument (to the extent covered by the CLO).  \nPurchased financial guarantees entered into to mitigate credit exposure from debt instruments included in the Other \nbusiness model are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. \nLeasing transactions \nThe Group enters into lease contracts, predominantly for land and buildings, as a lessee. Other categories are company \ncars and technical/IT equipment. \nIn calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease \ncommencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement \ndate, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments \nmade. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is re-measured if there is a modification, a change in the lease \nterm or a change in the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used \nto determine such lease payments). \nRight-of-use assets are assessed for any indication of impairment at each quarterly reporting date. If such indication exists, \nthe recoverable amount, which is the fair value less costs of disposal, must be estimated and an impairment charge is \nrecorded to the extent the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount. As right-of-use assets do not have \nindependently generated cash flows to calculate its value in use, the Group considers any sublease income that could \nreasonably be earned. After the recognition of impairment of an asset, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods \nto reflect the asset’s revised carrying amount. If an impairment is later reversed, the depreciation charge is adjusted \nprospectively. \nThe Group presents right-of-use assets in “Property and Equipment” and lease liabilities in “Other Liabilities”.  \nThe Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term leases, i.e., those leases that have a lease \nterm of 12 months or less from the commencement date. It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition \nexemption to leases of technical/IT equipment that are considered to be low value. Lease payments on short-term leases \nand leases of low value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \n"}

In addition to defined contribution plans, there are retirement benefit plans \naccounted for as defined benefit plans. The assets of all the Group’s defined contribution plans are held in independently \nadministered funds. Contributions are generally determined as a percentage of salary and are expensed based on \nemployee services rendered, generally in the year of contribution. \nAll retirement benefit plans accounted for as defined benefit plans are valued using the projected unit-credit method to \ndetermine the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related service costs. Under this method, the \ndetermination is based on actuarial calculations which include assumptions about demographics, salary increases and \ninterest and inflation rates. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income and presented in \nequity in the period in which they occur. The majority of the Group’s benefit plans is funded. \nFor the Group’s most significant pension plans in the key countries, the discount rate used at each measurement date is \nset based on a high-quality corporate bond yield curve – derived based on bond universe information sourced from \nreputable third-party index data providers and rating agencies – reflecting the timing, amount and currency of the future \nexpected benefit payments for the respective plan. \nOther post-employment benefits \nIn addition, the Group maintains unfunded contributory post-employment medical plans for a number of current and \nretired employees who are mainly located in the United States. These plans pay stated percentages of eligible medical and \ndental expenses of retirees after a stated deductible has been met. The Group funds these plans on a cash basis as benefits \nare due. Analogous to retirement benefit plans these plans are valued using the projected unit-credit method. Actuarial \ngains and losses are recognized in full in the period in which they occur in other comprehensive income and presented in \nequity. \nRefer to Note 33 “Employee benefits” for further information on the accounting for pension benefits and other post-\nemployment benefits. \nTermination benefits \nTermination benefits arise when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date or whenever \nan employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. The Group recognizes termination benefits as \na liability and an expense if the Group is demonstrably committed to a detailed formal plan without realistic possibility of \nwithdrawal. In the case of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy, termination benefits are measured based on \nthe number of employees expected to accept the offer. Benefits falling due more than twelve months after the end of the \nreporting period are discounted to their present value. The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields on \nhigh-quality corporate bonds. \nShare-based compensation \nCompensation expense for awards classified as equity instruments is measured at the grant date based on the fair value \nof the share-based award. For share awards, the fair value is the quoted market price of the share reduced by the present \nvalue of the expected dividends that will not be received by the employee and adjusted for the effect, if any, of restrictions \nbeyond the vesting date. In case an award is modified such that its fair value immediately after modification exceeds its \nfair value immediately prior to modification, a remeasurement takes place and the resulting increase in fair value is \nrecognized as additional compensation expense. \nThe Group records the offsetting amount to the recognized compensation expense in additional paid-in capital (“APIC”). \nCompensation expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the period in which employees perform services to which \nthe awards relate or over the period of the tranches for those awards delivered in tranches. Estimates of expected \nforfeitures are periodically adjusted in the event of actual forfeitures or for changes in expectations. The timing of expense \nrecognition relating to grants which, due to early retirement provisions, include a nominal but non-substantive service \nperiod are accelerated by shortening the amortization period of the expense from the grant date to the date when the \nemployee meets the eligibility criteria for the award, and not the vesting date. For awards that are delivered in tranches, \neach tranche is considered a separate award and amortized separately. \n"}

The related obligations are \nincluded in other liabilities until paid. \nOther deferred compensation plans \nCompensation expense for other deferred compensation plans is recorded on a straight-line basis over the period in which \nemployees perform services to which the awards relate or over the period of the tranches for those awards delivered in \ntranches. For awards that are delivered in tranches, each tranche is considered a separate award and amortized separately. \nThe amount recognized is based on the present value of the amount expected to be paid under the respective plan and is \nremeasured at each reporting date. The ultimate cumulative compensation expense recognized equals the cash or the fair \nvalue of the respective financial instruments delivered. \nGovernment grants \nThe Group recognizes income from government grants when there is reasonable assurance that it will receive the grant \nand will comply with the conditions attached to the grant. The benefit is recognized in the period in which the grant is \nintended to compensate the Group for related costs and presented as a reduction of the related expense.  \nThe Group considered the initial benefits that arose from borrowing under TLTRO III as government grant from a below-\nmarket loan under IAS 20 and recognized subsequent benefits in accordance with IFRS 9. Since November 23, 2022, all \nremaining TLTRO III operations are indexed to the average applicable key ECB interest rates. \nFor further information on the benefit recognized by the Group from the TLTRO III refinancing program see Note 5 “Net \ninterest income and net gains (losses) on financial assets/liabilities at fair value through profit or loss”. \nOptions and forwards on common shares \nOption and forward contracts on Deutsche Bank shares are classified as equity if the number of shares is fixed and physical \nsettlement is required. All other contracts in which Deutsche Bank shares are the underlying are recorded as financial \nassets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.  \nConsolidated statement of cash flows  \nThe consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method, which adjusts Profit (loss) \nfor non-cash transactions within operating activities and distinguishes the classification of cash flows between operating, \ninvesting, or financing activities depending on the business model and the related activities which are most appropriate to \nthe business.  \nFor purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, the Group’s cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid \ninvestments that are readily convertible into cash, and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. Such \ninvestments include cash and balances at central banks and demand deposits with banks.  \nThere are various circumstances in which cash and cash equivalent balances held by Deutsche Bank are not available for \nuse by the Group. Examples include cash and cash equivalent balances held by a subsidiary that operates in a country \nwhere exchange controls or other legal restrictions apply such that the balances are not available for general use by the \nGroup or its subsidiaries. \nDue to the nature of Deutsche Bank’s business model of providing financing to clients, cash flows related to long-term \ndebt support the bank’s operating activities and are included as a component of operating activities. In contrast, cash flows \nrelated to transactions on own equity transactions as well as subordinated long-term debt and trust preferred securities \nare presented as financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. These financial instruments are viewed \ndifferently from those related to senior-long term debt because they are managed as an integral part of the Group’s capital, \nprimarily to meet regulatory capital requirements. As a result, these financial instruments are not interchangeable with \nother operating liabilities but can only be interchanged with equity and thus are considered part of the financing category. \nThe Group’s adjustments for certain non-cash transactions to Profit (loss) includes provisions for credit losses, \nrestructuring activities, deferred income taxes and impairments, depreciations, amortization, and accretions, which also \nincludes amortization of hedge adjustments.  \n"}

For example, unrealized fair value changes for trading assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit and loss \nare included in operating activities and do not distinguish between cash and non-cash market movements. This also applies \nto foreign exchange movements realized in the income statement when translating the transaction currency to the entity’s \nfunctional currency.

The \namendment did not have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.  \nIAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” \nOn January 1, 2024, the Group adopted amendments to IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of \nLiabilities as Current or Non-Current”. The amendments clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current \nshould be based on rights that are in existence at the end of the reporting period. The amendments also clarify that the \nclassification is unaffected by expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of a liability \nand make clear that settlement refers to the transfer to the counterparty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or \nservices. They did not have a material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.  \nOn January 1, 2024, the Group adopted a further amendment to IAS 1 that modifies the requirements described above on \nhow an entity classifies debt and other financial liabilities as current or non-current in particular circumstances. \nAccordingly, it clarifies that only covenants with which an entity is required to comply on or before the reporting date \naffect the classification of a liability as current or non-current. The amendments did not have a material impact on the \nGroup’s consolidated financial statements.  \nNew accounting pronouncements \nThe following accounting pronouncements were not effective as of December 31, 2024, and therefore have not been \napplied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. \nIAS 21 “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates” \nIn August 2023, the IASB issued “Lack of Exchangeability (Amendments to IAS 21)” that contains guidance to specify when \na currency is exchangeable and how to determine the exchange rate when it is not. It also requires the disclosure of \nadditional information when a currency is not exchangeable. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning \non or after January 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact \non the Group’s consolidated financial statements.  \nIFRS 18 “Presentation and Disclosures in Financial Statements” \nIn April 2024, the IASB issued the new standard IFRS 18 “Presentation and Disclosures in Financial Statements” that \nreplaces IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”. The new standard contains new guidance on how to structure the \nIncome Statement as well as disclosure requirements for Management-defined Performance Measures (MPMs). The new \nstandard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2027, with early adoption permitted.

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 452, "text": " \n \n420  \nDeutsche Bank  \nNotes to the consolidated financial statements \nAnnual Report 2024 \n04 – Business segments and related information \nCommencing from the first quarter of 2024, Private Bank is following a customer-focused approach by classifying the \nexisting customer base into two distinct global client sectors: “Personal Banking” as well as “Wealth Management & Private \nBanking”. This approach reflects the focus to serve clients in a more targeted and effective way across the Private Bank. \nWealth Management & Private Banking combines the coverage of private banking, high-net-worth and ultra high-net-\nworth clients, as well as business clients in selected international businesses (reflecting the ‘Bank for Entrepreneurs’ \nstrategy). The client sector Personal Banking includes retail and affluent customers as well as commercial banking clients \nin Italy and Spain (i.e., all small business clients and small sized corporate clients that are not covered as part of the Wealth \nManagement & Private Banking client sector). Prior years’ comparatives are presented in the current reporting structure. \nWithin the new Private Bank coverage area ‘Wealth Management & Private Banking’, private clients benefit from a wider \nproduct range with increased emphasis on investment advice. As a result, demand deposits of Private Banking Germany \nwere reclassified to assets under management, ensuring a consistent treatment within ‘Wealth Management & Private \nBanking’. Prior years’ comparatives are presented in the current reporting structure. \nMeasurement of segment profit or loss \nSegment reporting requires a presentation of the segment results based on management reporting methods, including a \nreconciliation between the results of the business segments and the consolidated financial statements, which is presented \nin the “Segment results of operations” section within this note. The information provided about each segment is based on \ninternal management reporting about segment profit or loss, assets and other information which is regularly reviewed by \nthe chief operating decision maker.  \nSegment assets are presented in the Group’s internal management reporting based on a consolidated view, i.e., the \namounts do not include intersegment balances. The Group`s internal management reporting does not consider segment \nliabilities or interest expense separately. Similarly, depreciation and amortization, tax expenses and other comprehensive \nincome are not presented separately internally and are therefore not disclosed here. \nNon-IFRS compliant accounting methods used in the Group’s management reporting represent either valuation or \nclassification differences. The largest valuation differences relate to measurement at fair value in management reporting \nversus measurement at amortized cost under IFRS and to the recognition of trading results from own shares in revenues \nin management reporting (in Investment Bank) and in equity under IFRS. The major classification difference relates to \nnoncontrolling interest, which represents the net share of minority shareholders in revenues, provision for credit losses, \nnoninterest expenses and income tax expenses. Noncontrolling interest is reported as a component of the profit before \ntax of the businesses in management reporting (with a reversal in Corporate & Other) and a component of net income \nappropriation under IFRS. \nSince the Group’s business activities are diverse in nature and its operations are integrated, certain estimates and \njudgments have been made to apportion revenue and expense items among the business segments.  \nThe management reporting systems allocate the Group’s external net interest income according to the value of funding \nconsumed or provided by each business segment’s activities, in accordance with the bank’s internal funds transfer pricing \nframework. Furthermore, to retain comparability with those competitors that have legally independent units with their own \nequity funding, the Group allocates a net notional interest benefit on its consolidated capital, in line with each segment’s \nproportion of average shareholders’ equity.  \nManagement uses certain measures for equity and related ratios as part of its internal reporting system because it believes \nthat these measures provide it with a useful indication of the financial performance of the business segments. The Group \ndiscloses such measures to provide investors and analysts with further insight into how management operates the Group’s \nbusinesses and to enable them to better understand the Group’s results.  \nAllocation of Average Shareholder’s Equity  \nShareholders’ equity is fully allocated to the Group’s segments based on the regulatory capital demand of each segment. \nRegulatory capital demand reflects the combined contribution of each segment to the Groups’ Common Equity Tier 1 \n(CET1) ratio, the Groups’ leverage ratio and the Group’s capital loss under stress. Contributions in each of the three \ndimensions are weighted to reflect their relative importance and level of constraint for the Group. Contributions to the \nCET1 ratio and the leverage ratio are measured through risk-weighted assets and leverage ratio exposure. The Group’s \ncapital loss under stress is a measure of the Group’s overall economic risk exposure under a defined stress scenario. \nGoodwill and other intangible assets are directly attributed to the Group’s segments in order to allow the determination \nof allocated tangible shareholders’ equity and the respective returns. Shareholders’ equity and tangible shareholders’ \nequity is allocated on a monthly basis and averaged across quarters and for the full year.  \n"}

During 2023, costs relating to Infrastructure functions \nwere allocated using an actuals to plan approach, with the exception of technology development costs which were \ncharged to the divisions based on actual expenditures. Beginning 2024, all infrastructure costs were charged to divisions \nbased on actual costs and service consumption.

While the update of the 2023 allocations impacted \nthe segmental post-tax returns on average tangible shareholders’ equity and cost/income ratio, the respective Group \nmetrics are unaffected by the methodology change. \nChanges to Operational Risk RWA allocation framework  \nStarting in 2024, Deutsche Bank introduced a refined and more granular framework to allocate operational risk RWA to \nthe segments. While the respective segmental RWA metrics are impacted by the change in methodology with a more \npronounced impact from the second quarter of 2024 onwards, the Group’s operational risk RWA are unaffected by the \nchange. \nStrategic Liquidity Reserve Profit and Loss Allocation \nCommencing from the first quarter of 2022, the methodology for divisional intra-year allocations of profit or loss earned \non the Strategic Liquidity Reserves has been refined. As part of the introduction of the new methodology, the intra-year \nprofit and loss volatility is held centrally in Corporate & Other in order to better reflect the underlying performance of the \nbusiness divisions. The implementation of the new methodology does not impact the overall group revenues or the annual \nbusiness allocations, therefore the full year results for 2022 are not impacted.  \nTax Exempt Securities \nNet interest income as a component of net revenues, profit (loss) before tax and related ratios are presented on a fully \ntaxable-equivalent basis for tax-exempt securities for the Investment Bank. This enables management to measure \nperformance of taxable and tax-exempt securities on a comparable basis. This presentation resulted in an increase in \nInvestment Bank net interest income of € 23 million for full year 2024, € 10 million for full year 2023 and € 33 million for \nfull year 2022. This increase is offset in Group consolidated figures through a reversal in Corporate & Other. The \npredominant tax rate used for 2024, 2023 and 2022 in determining the fully taxable equivalent of the net interest income \nwas 21% and related to U.S. tax exempt securities. \n \n"}

They \nare managed on a discretionary or advisory basis or are deposited with the bank. Deposits are considered Assets under Management if they serve investment purposes. In \nPersonal Banking, this includes Term deposits and Savings deposits. In Wealth Management & Private Banking (excl. Business Banking), it is assumed that all customer \ndeposits are held with the bank primarily for investment purposes and accordingly are classified as Assets under Management. Within the Private Bank business ‘Wealth \nManagement & Private Banking’, private clients benefit from a wider product range with increased emphasis on investment advice. As a result, starting 2024, demand \ndeposits of Private Banking in Germany were reclassified to Assets under Management, ensuring a consistent treatment within ‘Wealth Management & Private Banking’.

As of December 31, 2024, \nthere were performance obligations to be satisfied of € 250 million with a time band of four years from 2025 to 2028 (as \nof December 31, 2023, € 225 million with a time band of three years from 2025 to 2027) from Alternative funds.

As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Group’s balance \nof contract liabilities associated to commission and fee income was € 84 million and € 90 million, respectively. Contract \nliabilities arise from the Group’s obligation to provide future services to a customer for which it has received consideration \nfrom the customer prior to completion of the services. The balances of receivables and contract liabilities do not vary \nsignificantly from period to period reflecting the fact that they predominately relate to recurring service contracts with \nservice periods of less than one year such as monthly current account services and quarterly asset management services. \nAs a result, prior period balances of contract liabilities are generally recognized in revenue in the subsequent period. There \nare some contracts where customer payment in exchange for services provided by the Group over the service period are \nnot required until the end of the contract period. If the Group is virtually certain to receive payment at the end of the \ncontract period, a contract asset and respective commission and fee income is recognized when services are performed. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the bank has recognized no material contract assets. \n"}

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 472, "text": "440 \nDeutsche Bank  \nNotes to the consolidated balance sheet \nAnnual Report 2024 \n13 – Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value \n13 – Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value \nValuation methods and control \nThe Group has an established valuation control framework which governs internal control standards, methodologies, and \nprocedures over the valuation process.  \nPrices quoted in active markets – The fair value of instruments that are quoted in active markets are determined using the \nquoted prices where they represent prices at which regularly and recently occurring transactions take place. \nValuation techniques – The Group uses valuation techniques to establish the fair value of instruments where prices, quoted \nin active markets, are not available. Valuation techniques used for financial instruments include modelling techniques, the \nuse of indicative quotes for proxy instruments, quotes from recent and less regular transactions and broker quotes. \nFor some financial instruments a rate or other parameter, rather than a price, is quoted. Where this is the case then the \nmarket rate or parameter is used as an input to a valuation model to determine fair value. For some instruments, modelling \ntechniques follow industry standard models, for example, discounted cash flow analysis and standard option pricing \nmodels. These models are dependent upon estimated future cash flows, discount factors and volatility levels. For more \ncomplex or unique instruments, more sophisticated modelling techniques are required, and may rely upon assumptions or \nmore complex parameters such as correlations, prepayment speeds, default rates and loss severity. \nFrequently, valuation models require multiple parameter inputs. Where possible, parameter inputs are based on \nobservable data or are derived from the prices of relevant instruments traded in active markets. Where observable data is \nnot available for parameter inputs, then other market information is considered. For example, indicative broker quotes and \nconsensus pricing information are used to support parameter inputs where they are available. Where no observable \ninformation is available to support parameter inputs then they are based on other relevant sources of information such as \nprices for similar transactions, historic data, economic fundamentals, and research information, with appropriate \nadjustment to reflect the terms of the actual instrument being valued and current market conditions. \nValuation adjustments – Valuation adjustments are an integral part of the valuation process. In making appropriate \nvaluation adjustments, the Group follows methodologies that consider factors such as bid-offer spreads, \ncounterparty/own credit and funding risk. Bid offer spread valuation adjustments are required to adjust mid-market \nvaluations to the appropriate bid or offer valuation. The bid or offer valuation is the best representation of the fair value \nfor an instrument. The carrying value of a long position is adjusted from mid to bid, and the carrying value of a short position \nis adjusted from mid to offer. Bid-offer valuation adjustments are determined from bid-offer prices observed in relevant \ntrading activity and in quotes from other broker-dealers or other knowledgeable counterparties. Where the quoted price \nfor the instrument is already a bid-offer price then no additional bid-offer valuation adjustment is necessary. Where the \nfair value of financial instruments is derived from a modelling technique, then the parameter inputs into that model are \nnormally at a mid-market level. Such instruments are generally managed on a portfolio basis and, when specified criteria \nare met, valuation adjustments are taken to reflect the cost of closing out the net exposure the Bank has to individual \nmarket or counterparty risks. These adjustments are determined from bid-offer prices observed in relevant trading activity \nand quotes from other broker-dealers. \nWhere complex valuation models are used, or where less-liquid positions are being valued, then bid-offer levels for those \npositions may not be available directly from the market, and therefore for the close-out cost of these positions, models \nand parameters must be estimated. When these adjustments are designed, the Group closely examines the valuation risks \nassociated with the model as well as the positions themselves, and the resulting adjustments are closely monitored on an \nongoing basis. \nCounterparty credit valuation adjustments (CVAs) are required to cover expected credit losses to the extent that the \nvaluation technique does not already include an expected credit loss factor relating to the non-performance risk of the \ncounterparty. The CVA amount is applied to all relevant over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, and is determined by \nassessing the potential credit exposure to a given counterparty and taking into account any collateral held, the effect of \nany relevant netting arrangements, expected loss given default and the probability of default, based on available market \ninformation, including credit default swap (CDS) spreads. Where counterparty CDS spreads are not available, relevant \nproxies are used.  \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 473, "text": " \n \n441  \nDeutsche Bank  \nNotes to the consolidated balance sheet \nAnnual Report 2024 \n13 – Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value \nThe fair value of the Group’s financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (i.e., OTC derivative liabilities and issued \nnote liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss) incorporates valuation adjustments to measure the change \nin the Group’s own credit risk (i.e., debt valuation adjustments (DVA) for derivatives and own credit adjustment (OCA) for \nissued note liabilities). Issued note liabilities are discounted utilizing the spread at which similar instruments would be \ntraded as at the measurement date as this reflects the value from the perspective of a market participant who holds the \nidentical item as an asset. The change in this own credit component is reported under other comprehensive income (OCI). \nFor derivative liabilities the Group considers its own creditworthiness by assessing all counterparties expected future \nexposure to the Group, taking into account any collateral posted by the Group, the effect of relevant netting arrangements, \nthe market price of the Group’s issued note liabilities, the market implied funding costs and the seniority of derivative \nclaims under resolution (statutory subordination). \nWhen determining CVA and DVA, additional adjustments are made where appropriate to achieve fair value, due to the \nexpected loss estimate of a particular arrangement, or where the credit risk being assessed differs in nature to that \ndescribed by the available CDS instrument. \nFunding valuation adjustments (FVA) are required to incorporate the market implied funding costs into the fair value of \nderivative positions. The FVA reflects a discounting spread applied to uncollateralized and partially collateralized \nderivatives and is determined by assessing the market-implied funding costs on both assets and liabilities.  \nWhere there is uncertainty in the assumptions used within a modelling technique, an additional adjustment is taken to \ncalibrate the model price to the expected market price of the financial instrument. Typically, such transactions have bid-\noffer levels which are less observable, and these adjustments aim to estimate the bid-offer by computing the liquidity-\npremium associated with the transaction. Where a financial instrument is of sufficient complexity that the cost of closing \nit out would be higher than the cost of closing out its component risks, then an additional adjustment is taken to reflect \nthis. \nThe Group uses the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Where relevant, \nthese assumptions may include assumptions about climate change. The Group has not made material adjustment to fair \nvalue for climate change beyond that already priced into market inputs. \nValuation control – The Group has an independent specialized valuation control group within the Risk function which \ngoverns and develops the valuation control framework and manages the valuation control processes. The mandate of this \nspecialist function includes the performance of the independent valuation control process for all businesses, the \ncontinued development of valuation control methodologies and techniques, as well as devising and governing the formal \nvaluation control policy framework. Special attention of this independent valuation control group is directed to areas \nwhere management judgment forms part of the valuation process. \nResults of the valuation control process are collected and analyzed as part of a standard monthly reporting cycle. \nVariances of differences outside of preset and approved tolerance levels are escalated both within the finance function \nand with senior business management for review, resolution and, if required, adjustment.  \nFor instruments where fair value is determined from valuation models, the assumptions and techniques used within the \nmodels are independently validated by an independent specialist model validation group that is part of the Group’s Risk \nManagement function.  \nQuotes for transactions and parameter inputs are obtained from a number of third party sources including exchanges, \npricing service providers, firm broker quotes and consensus pricing services. Price sources are examined and assessed to \ndetermine the quality of fair value information they represent, with greater emphasis given to those possessing greater \nvaluation certainty and relevance. The results are compared against actual transactions in the market to ensure the model \nvaluations are calibrated to market prices.  \nPrice and parameter inputs to models, assumptions and valuation adjustments are verified against independent sources. \nWhere they cannot be verified to independent sources due to lack of observable information, the estimate of fair value is \nsubject to procedures to assess its reasonableness. Such procedures include performing revaluation using independently \ngenerated models (including where existing models are independently recalibrated), assessing the valuations against \nappropriate proxy instruments and other benchmarks, and performing extrapolation techniques. Assessment is made as to \nwhether the valuation techniques produce fair value estimates that are reflective of market levels by calibrating the results \nof the valuation models against market transactions where possible.  \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 474, "text": " \n \n442  \nDeutsche Bank  \nNotes to the consolidated balance sheet \nAnnual Report 2024 \n13 – Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value \nValuation techniques  \nThe Group has an established valuation control framework which governs internal control standards, methodologies, \nvaluation techniques and procedures over the valuation process and fair value measurement. The current market \nconditions including the ongoing macro-economic challenges and geopolitical uncertainties required additional focus and \nreview in certain areas, during the year 2024 including assessment of bid-offer spreads to ensure they are representative \nof fair value. \nThe following is an explanation of the valuation techniques used in establishing the fair value of the different types of \nfinancial instruments that the Group trades. \nSovereign, quasi-sovereign and corporate debt and equity securities – Where there are no recent transactions then fair \nvalue may be determined from the last market price adjusted for all changes in risks and information since that date. Where \na close proxy instrument is quoted in an active market then fair value is determined by adjusting the proxy value for \ndifferences in the risk profile of the instruments. Where close proxies are not available then fair value is estimated using \nmore complex modelling techniques. These techniques include discounted cash flow models using current market rates \nfor credit, interest, liquidity and other risks. For equity securities modeling techniques may also include those based on \nearnings multiples. \nMortgage- and other asset-backed securities (MBS/ABS) include residential and commercial MBS and other ABS including \ncollateralized debt obligations (CDO). ABS have specific characteristics as they have different underlying assets, and the \nissuing entities have different capital structures. The complexity increases further where the underlying assets are \nthemselves ABS, as is the case with many of the CDO instruments. \nWhere no reliable external pricing is available, ABS are valued, where applicable, using either relative value analysis which \nis performed based on similar transactions observable in the market, or industry-standard valuation models making largest \npossible use of available observable inputs. The industry standard models calculate principal and interest payments for a \ngiven deal based on assumptions that can be independently price tested. The inputs include prepayment speeds, loss \nassumptions (timing and severity) and a discount rate (spread, yield or discount margin). These inputs/assumptions are \nderived from actual transactions, external market research and market indices where appropriate. \nLoans – For certain loans fair value may be determined from the market price on a recently occurring transaction adjusted \nfor all changes in risks and information since that transaction date. Where there are no recent market transactions then \nbroker quotes, consensus pricing, proxy instruments or discounted cash flow models are used to determine fair value. \nDiscounted cash flow models incorporate parameter inputs for credit risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, loss \ngiven default estimates and amounts utilized given default, as appropriate. Credit risk, loss given default and utilization \ngiven default parameters are determined using information from the loan or CDS markets, where available and appropriate.  \nLeveraged loans can have transaction-specific characteristics which can limit the relevance of market-observed \ntransactions. Where similar transactions exist for which observable quotes are available from external pricing services then \nthis information is used with appropriate adjustments to reflect the transaction differences. When no similar transactions \nexist, a discounted cash flow valuation technique is used with credit spreads derived from the appropriate leveraged loan \nindex, incorporating the industry classification, subordination of the loan, and any other relevant information on the loan \nand loan counterparty. \nOver-the-counter derivative financial instruments – Market standard transactions in liquid trading markets, such as interest \nrate swaps, foreign exchange forward and option contracts in G7 currencies, and equity swap and option contracts on \nlisted securities or indices are valued using market standard models and quoted parameter inputs. Parameter inputs are \nobtained from pricing services, consensus pricing services and recently occurring transactions in active markets wherever \npossible.  \nMore complex instruments are modeled using more sophisticated modeling techniques specific for the instrument and are \ncalibrated to available market prices. Where the model output value does not calibrate to a relevant market reference then \nvaluation adjustments are made to the model output value to adjust for any difference. In less active markets, data is \nobtained from less frequent market transactions, broker quotes and through extrapolation and interpolation techniques. \nWhere observable prices or inputs are not available, management judgment is required to determine fair values by \nassessing other relevant sources of information such as historical data, fundamental analysis of the economics of the \ntransaction and proxy information from similar transactions.  \n \n \n"}

Under IFRS 9, the own credit component of change in the fair value is reported under other \ncomprehensive income (OCI). Financial liabilities included in this classification are structured note issuances, structured \ndeposits, and other structured securities issued by consolidated vehicles. The fair value of these financial liabilities is \ndetermined by discounting the contractual cash flows using the relevant credit-adjusted yield curve (i.e., utilizing the \nspread at which similar instruments would be traded as at the measurement date as this reflects the value from the \nperspective of a market participant who holds the identical item as an asset). \nWhere the financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option are collateralized, \nsuch as securities loaned and securities sold under repurchase agreements, the credit enhancement is factored into the \nfair valuation of the liability. \nInvestment contract liabilities – Assets which are linked to the investment contract liabilities are owned by the Group. The \ninvestment contract obliges the Group to use these assets to settle these liabilities. Therefore, the fair value of investment \ncontract liabilities is determined by the fair value of the underlying assets (i.e., amount payable on surrender of the policies). \nFair value hierarchy \nThe financial instruments carried at fair value have been categorized under the three levels of the IFRS fair value hierarchy \nas follows: \nLevel 1 – Instruments valued using quoted prices in active markets are instruments where the fair value can be determined \ndirectly from prices which are quoted in active, liquid markets. \nThese include: government bonds, exchange-traded derivatives and equity securities traded on active, liquid exchanges.  \nLevel 2 – Instruments valued with valuation techniques using observable market data are instruments where the fair value \ncan be determined by reference to similar instruments trading in active markets, or where a technique is used to derive the \nvaluation but where all significant inputs to that technique are observable.  \nThese include: many OTC derivatives, many investment-grade listed credit bonds, some CDS. \nLevel 3 – Instruments valued using valuation techniques using market data which is not directly observable are instruments \nwhere the fair value cannot be determined directly by reference to market-observable information, and some other pricing \ntechnique must be employed. Instruments classified in this category have an input to that technique which is \nunobservable, and which can have a significant impact on the fair value. \nThese include: more-complex OTC derivatives, distressed debt, highly-structured bonds, illiquid asset-backed securities \n(ABS), illiquid CDO’s (cash and synthetic), some private equity placements, many commercial real estate (CRE) loans, \nilliquid loans, and some municipal bonds. \n"}

The \nseparated embedded derivatives may have a positive or a negative fair value but have been presented in this table to be consistent with the classification of the host \ncontract. The separated embedded derivatives are held at fair value on a recurring basis and have been split between the fair value hierarchy classifications \nDuring the year 2024, there were transfers in trading securities and non-trading financial assets from Level 1 to Level 2 \namounting to € 14 billion of assets and € 6 billion of liabilities; along with transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 of € 9 billion in \nassets and € 3 billion in liabilities. The assessment of Level 1 versus Level 2 is based on liquidity testing procedures. \nAnalysis of financial instruments with fair value derived from valuation \ntechniques containing significant unobservable parameters (Level 3) \nSome of the financial assets and financial liabilities in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy have identical or similar offsetting \nexposures to the unobservable input. However, according to IFRS they are required to be presented gross. \nTrading securities – Certain illiquid emerging market corporate bonds and illiquid highly structured corporate bonds are \nincluded in this level of the hierarchy. In addition, some of the holdings of notes issued by securitization entities, \ncommercial and residential MBS, collateralized debt obligation securities and other ABS are reported here. The decrease \nin the period is driven by sales, settlements, and net transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 due to changes in the \nobservability of input parameters used to value these instruments, partially offset by purchases and gains.  \nPositive and negative market values from derivative instruments categorized in this level of the fair value hierarchy are \nvalued based on one or more significant unobservable parameters.

As of December 31, 2023 it could have increased fair value by as much as \n€ 1.8 billion or decreased fair value by as much as € 1.3 billion.  \nThe changes in sensitive amounts from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 were an increase in positive fair value \nmovement of € 261 million, and an increase in negative fair value movement of € 64 million.  \nThe change in positive fair value movements from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 represents a 15% increase \nand the change in negative fair value movements represents a 5% increase. In the period, the bank has made refinements \nto the methodology for the calculation of L3 fair value sensitivity. These do not change the fair value of the L3 financial \ninstruments. The Group’s sensitivity calculation of unobservable parameters for level 3 continues to align to the approach \nused to assess valuation uncertainty for prudent valuation purposes. \nThis disclosure is intended to illustrate the potential impact of the relative uncertainty in the fair value of financial \ninstruments for which valuation is dependent on unobservable input parameters. However, it is unlikely in practice that all \nunobservable parameters would be simultaneously at the extremes of their ranges of reasonably possible alternatives. \nHence, the estimates disclosed above are likely to be greater than the true uncertainty in fair value at the balance sheet \ndate. Furthermore, the disclosure is neither predictive nor indicative of future movements in fair value. \nFor many of the financial instruments considered here, in particular derivatives, unobservable input parameters represent \nonly a subset of the parameters required to price the financial instrument, the remainder being observable. Hence, for \nthese instruments the overall impact of moving the unobservable input parameters to the extremes of their ranges might \nbe relatively small compared with the total fair value of the financial instrument. For other instruments, fair value is \ndetermined based on the price of the entire instrument, for example, by adjusting the fair value of a reasonable proxy \ninstrument. In addition, all financial instruments are already carried at fair values which are inclusive of valuation \nadjustments for the cost to close out that instrument and hence already factor in uncertainty as it reflects itself in market \npricing.

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 481, "text": " \n \n449  \nDeutsche Bank  \nNotes to the consolidated balance sheet \nAnnual Report 2024 \n13 – Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value \nQuantitative information about the sensitivity of significant unobservable inputs \nThe behavior of the unobservable parameters on Level 3 fair value measurement is not necessarily independent, and \ndynamic relationships often exist between the other unobservable parameters and the observable parameters. Such \nrelationships, where material to the fair value of a given instrument, are explicitly captured via correlation parameters, or \nare otherwise controlled via pricing models or valuation techniques. Frequently, where a valuation technique utilizes more \nthan one input, the choice of a certain input will bound the range of possible values for other inputs. In addition, broader \nmarket factors (such as interest rates, equity, credit or commodity indices or foreign exchange rates) can also have effects. \nThe range of values shown below represents the highest and lowest inputs used to value the significant exposures within \nLevel 3. The diversity of financial instruments that make up the disclosure is significant and therefore the ranges of certain \nparameters can be large. For example, the range of credit spreads on mortgage-backed securities represents performing, \nmore liquid positions with lower spreads than the less liquid, non-performing positions which will have higher credit \nspreads. As Level 3 contains the less liquid fair value instruments, the wide ranges of parameters seen is to be expected, \nas there is a high degree of pricing differentiation within each exposure type to capture the relevant market dynamics. The \ntable below provides a brief description of each of the principal parameter types, along with a commentary on significant \ninterrelationships between them. \nCredit Parameters are used to assess the creditworthiness of an exposure, by enabling the probability of default and \nresulting losses of a default to be represented. The credit spread is the primary reflection of creditworthiness and \nrepresents the premium or yield return above the benchmark reference instrument (typically LIBOR, or relevant Treasury \nInstrument, depending upon the asset being assessed), that a bond holder would require to allow for the credit quality \ndifference between that entity and the reference benchmark. Higher credit spreads will indicate lower credit quality, and \nlead to a lower value for a given bond, or other loan-asset that is to be repaid to the bank by the borrower. Recovery rates \nrepresent an estimate of the amount a lender would receive in the case of a default of a loan, or a bond holder would \nreceive in the case of default of the bond. Higher recovery rates will give a higher valuation for a given bond position, if \nother parameters are held constant. Constant default rate and constant prepayment rate allow more complex loan and \ndebt assets to be assessed, as these parameters estimate the ongoing defaults arising on scheduled repayments and \ncoupons, or whether the borrower is making additional (usually voluntary) prepayments. These parameters are particularly \nrelevant when forming a fair value opinion for mortgage or other types of lending, where repayments are delivered by the \nborrower through time, or where the borrower may pre-pay the loan (seen for example in some residential mortgages). \nHigher constant default rate will lead to lower valuation of a given loan or mortgage as the lender will ultimately receive \nless cash.  \nInterest rates, credit spreads, inflation rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices are referenced in some option \ninstruments, or other complex derivatives, where the payoff a holder of the derivative will receive is dependent upon the \nbehavior of these underlying references through time. Volatility parameters describe key attributes of option behavior by \nenabling the variability of returns of the underlying instrument to be assessed. This volatility is a measure of probability, \nwith higher volatilities denoting higher probabilities of a particular outcome occurring. The underlying references (interest \nrates, credit spreads etc.) have an effect on the valuation of options, by describing the size of the return that can be \nexpected from the option. Therefore, the value of a given option is dependent upon the value of the underlying instrument, \nand the volatility of that instrument, representing the size of the payoff, and the probability of that payoff occurring. Where \nvolatilities are high, the option holder will see a higher option value as there is greater probability of positive returns. A \nhigher option value will also occur where the payoff described by the option is significant.  \nCorrelations are used to describe influential relationships between underlying references where a derivative or other \ninstrument has more than one underlying reference. Behind some of these relationships, for example commodity \ncorrelation and interest rate-foreign exchange correlations, typically lie macroeconomic factors such as the impact of \nglobal demand on groups of commodities, or the pricing parity effect of interest rates on foreign exchange rates. More \nspecific relationships can exist between credit references or equity stocks in the case of credit derivatives and equity \nbasket derivatives, for example. Credit correlations are used to estimate the relationship between the credit performance \nof a range of credit names, and stock correlations are used to estimate the relationship between the returns of a range of \nequities. A derivative with a correlation exposure will be either long- or short-correlation. A high correlation suggests a \nstrong relationship between the underlying references is in force, and this will lead to an increase in value of a long-\ncorrelation derivative. Negative correlations suggest that the relationship between underlying references is opposing, i.e., \nan increase in price of one underlying reference will lead to a reduction in the price of the other.  \nAn EBITDA (‘earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization’) multiple approach can be used in the valuation \nof less liquid securities. Under this approach the enterprise value (‘EV’) of an entity can be estimated via identifying the \nratio of the EV to EBITDA of a comparable observable entity and applying this ratio to the EBITDA of the entity for which \na valuation is being estimated. Under this approach a liquidity adjustment is often applied due to the difference in liquidity \nbetween the generally listed comparable used and the company under valuation.

For these instruments fair values are \ncalculated for disclosure purposes only and do not impact the Group balance sheet or income statement. Additionally, \nsince the instruments generally do not trade, there is significant management judgment required to determine these fair \nvalues. Differences between the carrying value and the fair value correspond to the movements in interest rates during the \nperiod. \nFor the following financial instruments which are predominantly short-term, the carrying value represents a reasonable \nestimate of the fair value: \nAssets \nLiabilities \nCash and central bank balances \nDeposits \nInterbank balances (w/o central banks) \nCentral bank funds purchased, and securities sold under repurchase \nagreements \nCentral bank funds sold, and securities purchased under resale \nagreements \nSecurities loaned \nSecurities borrowed \nOther short-term borrowings \nOther financial assets \nOther financial liabilities \nFor all other financial instruments carried at amortized cost, the following valuation techniques are applied: \n– Retail lending portfolios with a large number of homogenous loans (e.g., residential mortgages) calculate the fair value\nfor each product type by discounting the portfolio’s contractual cash flows using the Group’s new loan rates, for lending\nto borrowers of similar credit quality, which includes the impact of the macroeconomic environment. Key inputs for\nretail mortgages are the difference between historic and current product margins and the estimated prepayment rates. \nCapitalized broker fees included in the carrying value are also considered to be at fair value.\n– The fair value of the corporate lending portfolio is estimated predominantly by discounting the loan until it’s maturity,\nbased on the loan specific credit spreads and Deutsche Bank’s funding costs.\n– For long-term debt and trust preferred securities, fair value is determined from quoted market prices, where available.\nWhere quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated using a valuation technique that discounts the\nremaining contractual cash flows at a rate at which an instrument with similar characteristics is quoted in the market.\n– A discounted cash flow model is generally used for determining the fair value of long-term deposits since market data \nis usually not available. In addition to the yield curve, Deutsche Bank’s own credit spread is also considered. Credit\nspreads of the respective counterparties are not used in the measurement of fair value on financial liabilities at\namortized cost.\nFor these financial instruments carried at amortized costs, the disclosed fair value is categorized under the IFRS fair value \nhierarchy (i.e., Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3) as outlined in Note 13 - “Financial Instruments carried at Fair Value”. In general, \nLevel 1 includes Cash and Central bank balances; Level 2 includes Interbank balances (w/o central banks), Central bank \nfunds sold, and securities purchased under resale agreements, Securities borrowed, Other financial assets, Deposits, \nCentral bank funds purchased, and securities sold under repurchase agreements, Securities loaned, Other short- term \nborrowings, Other financial liabilities, Long- term debt and Trust preferred securities; and Level 3 includes Loans. \n"}

Partly offsetting the \nloan carrying amount were macro hedge accounting adjustments under the EU carve-out version of IAS 39, which were \n€ 5.0 billion as of December 31, 2024 and € 5.6 billion as of December 31, 2023. The deposits’ fair value was greater than \nthe carrying value as the carrying value included negative macro hedge accounting adjustments under the EU carve-out \nversion of IAS 39 of € 1.4 billion and € 3.4 billion as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. For long-\nterm debt and trust preferred securities, the difference between fair value and carrying value is due to the change in \ninterest rates at which the Group could issue debt with similar maturity and subordination at the balance sheet date \ncompared to the rate the instrument was issued at. The carrying values included in the table do not include any impacts \nfrom economic hedges. \n"}

The Group has applied \njudgement in presenting related information pursuant to IFRS 16 in a manner that it considers to be most relevant to an \nunderstanding of its financial performance and position. \nThe Group leases many assets including land and buildings, vehicles and IT equipment. The Group is a lessee for the \nmajority of its offices and branches under long-term rental agreements. Most of the lease contracts are made under usual \nterms and conditions, which means they include options to extend the lease by a defined amount of time, price adjustment \nclauses and escalation clauses in line with general office rental market conditions. However, the lease agreements do not \ninclude any clauses that impose any restriction on the Group’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt financing \ntransactions or enter into further lease agreements.  \nAs of December 31, 2024 (December 31, 2023), the Group recorded right-of-use assets on its balance sheet with a carrying \namount of € 3.9 billion (€ 4.0 billion), which are included in Property and equipment.

As of December 31, 2024, the lease liabilities included the discounted value of future lease payments of \n€ 440 million for the Group headquarters in Frankfurt am Main that was sold and leased back on December 1, 2011. The \nlease has a fixed term through to the end of 2036, with options to extend the lease for two additional five-year periods to \nthe end of 2046. \nDuring 2024 and 2023, interest expenses recorded from the compounding of the lease liabilities amounted to € 127 million \nand € 113 million, respectively. The contractual maturities for the undiscounted cash flows from these liabilities are shown \nin Note 31 “Maturity Analysis of the earliest contractual undiscounted cash flows of Financial Liabilities”. \nExpenses recognized in 2024 (2023) relating to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets, for which the Group \ndecided to apply the recognition exemption under IFRS 16 (and thus not to record right-of-use assets and corresponding \nlease liabilities on the balance sheet), amounted to € 2 million (€ 1 million) and € 0 million (€ 0 million), respectively.  \nIncome recorded in 2024 (2023) from the subletting of right-of-use assets totaled € 24 million (€ 29 million).  \nThe total cash outflow for leases for 2024 (2023) was € 678 million (€ 645 million) and represented mainly expenditures \nmade for real estate rentals over € 669 million (€ 638 million). Of the total cash outflow amount, payments of € 552 million \n(€ 534 million) were made for the principal portion of lease liabilities, payments of € 126 million (€ 111 million) were made \nfor the interest portion.  \nTotal future cash outflows to which the Group as a lessee is potentially exposed, that are not reflected in the measurement \nof the lease liabilities, mainly include potential payment exposures arising from extension options (2024: € 4.7 billion) and \nfuture payments for leases not yet commenced, but to which the Group is committed (2024: € 68 million).

The Group’s primary \nCGUs are as outlined above. Asset Management’s goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter by \ncomparing the recoverable amount of the CGU with its carrying amount. In addition, the Group tests goodwill whenever a \ntriggering event is identified. The recoverable amount is the higher of a CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value \nin use. The Asset Management CGU was the only goodwill carrying CGU to be tested for annual impairment in 2023 and \n2024. The impairment tests conducted on Asset Management in these periods did not result in an impairment loss as the \nrecoverable amounts of the Asset Management CGU were higher than the respective carrying amounts.  \nA review of the Group’s strategy or certain political or global risks for the banking industry, uncertainties regarding the \nimplementation of already adopted regulation and the introduction of legislation that is already under discussion could \nresult in an impairment of goodwill in the future. \nCarrying Amount \nThe carrying amount of a primary CGU is derived using a capital allocation model based on the Shareholders’ Equity \nAllocation Framework of the Group (please refer to Note 4, “Business Segments and Related Information” for more details). \nThe allocation uses the Group’s total equity at the date of valuation, including Additional Tier 1 Notes (AT1 Notes), which \nconstitute unsecured and subordinated notes of Deutsche Bank and which are classified as additional equity components \nin accordance with IFRS. Total equity is adjusted for an add-on adjustment for goodwill attributable to noncontrolling \ninterests.  \nRecoverable Amount  \nThe Group determines the recoverable amounts of its primary CGUs on the basis of the higher of value in use and fair value \nless costs of disposal (Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). It employs a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, which reflects \nthe specifics of the banking business and its regulatory environment. The model calculates the present value of the \nestimated future earnings that are distributable to shareholders after fulfilling the respective regulatory capital \nrequirements. The recoverable amounts also include the fair value of the AT1 Notes, which are allocated to the primary \nCGUs.  \nThe DCF model uses earnings projections and respective capitalization assumptions based on five-year financial plans as \nwell as longer term expectations on the impact of regulatory developments, which are discounted to their present value. \nEstimating future earnings and capital requirements involves judgment and the consideration of past and current \nperformances as well as expected developments in the respective markets, and in the overall macroeconomic and \nregulatory environments. Earnings projections beyond the initial five-year period are, where applicable, adjusted to derive \na sustainable level. In case of a going concern, the cash flow to equity is assumed to increase by or converge towards a \nconstant long-term growth rate for the Asset Management CGU of up to 3.3% (2023: up to 3.0%). This is based on projected \nrevenue forecasts of the CGU as well as expectations for the development of gross domestic product and inflation and is \ncaptured in the terminal value.  \n \n \n"}

The discount rates applied have been determined based on \nthe capital asset pricing model and comprise a risk-free interest rate, a market risk premium and a factor covering the \nsystematic market risk (beta factor). The values for the risk-free interest rate, the market risk premium and the beta factors \nare determined using external sources of information. CGU-specific beta factors are determined based on a respective \ngroup of peer companies. Variations in all of these components might impact the discount rates. For the Asset \nManagement CGU, the discount rates (after tax) applied for 2024 and 2023 were 10.4% and 10.9%, respectively. \nManagement determined the values for the key assumptions in the following table based on a combination of internal and \nexternal analysis. Estimates for efficiency and the cost reduction program are based on progress made to date and \nscheduled future projects and initiatives. \nKey management assumptions are: \nPrimary goodwill- \ncarrying cash-\ngenerating unit \nDescription of key assumptions \nUncertainty associated with key assumptions and potential \nevents/circumstances that could have a negative effect \nAsset Management \n— Strong organic growth: Build out Xtrackers and \nAlternatives offering, maintain robust performance in \nActive and further building out client channels and \npartnerships \n— Future of Finance: Emerge as a winner from disruption \nin the Asset Management space caused by digital \ndistribution channels \n— Gateway to Europe: Leverage global franchise and \nroots in Europe to become the first point of contact \nfor global investors targeting Europe \n— Challenging and continued uncertainty around the \nmarket environment and volatility unfavorable to its \ninvestment strategies \n— Unfavorable margin development and adverse \ncompetition levels in key markets and products \nbeyond expected levels \n— Business/execution risks, e.g., underachievement of \nnet flow targets from market uncertainty, loss of \nhigh-quality client facing employees, unfavorable \ninvestment performance, lower than expected \nefficiency gains \n— Uncertainty around regulation and its potential \nimplications not yet anticipated \n \n \n \nSensitivities: In order to test the resilience of the recoverable amount, key assumptions used in the DCF model (for example, \nthe discount rate and the earnings projections) are sensitized. Currently, in Asset Management the recoverable amount \nexceeds the carrying amount by 24%/€ 1.7 billion. \n \nChange in certain key assumptions to cause the recoverable amount to equal the carrying amount \nChange in Key Assumptions \nAsset \nManagement \nDiscount rate (post tax) increase \nfrom \n10.4% \nto \n12.3% \nChange in projected future earnings in each period by \n(16.9)% \nLong term growth rate \nfrom \n3.3% \nto \nN/M \n \nN/M – Not meaningful, as a rate of 0% would still lead to a recoverable amount in excess of the carrying amount \n"}

Due to the specific nature of these intangible assets, market prices are ordinarily not \nobservable and, therefore, the Group values such assets based on the income approach, using a post-tax DCF-\nmethodology.  \nRetail investment management agreements: These assets, amounting to € 764 million, relate to the Group’s U.S. retail \nmutual fund business and are allocated to the Asset Management CGU. Retail investment management agreements are \ncontracts that give Asset Management the exclusive right to manage a variety of mutual funds for a specified period. Since \nthese contracts are easily renewable at minimal cost, these agreements are not expected to have a foreseeable limit on \nthe contract period. Therefore, the rights to manage the associated assets under management are expected to generate \ncash flows for an indefinite period of time. This intangible asset was recorded at fair value based upon a valuation provided \nby a third party at the date of acquisition of Zurich Scudder Investments, Inc. in 2002.  \nThe recoverable amount was calculated as fair value less costs of disposal using the multi-period excess earnings method \napplying a five-year plan and the fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The key \nassumptions in determining the fair value less costs of disposal include the asset mix, the flows forecast, the effective fee \nrate and discount rate as well as the terminal value growth rate. The discount rate (cost of equity) applied in the annual \nimpairment test was 10.2% in 2024 (10.9% in 2023).

For \nrisk management purposes, operational risk includes legal risk, as payments to customers, counterparties and regulatory \nbodies in civil litigations or regulatory enforcement matters constitute loss events for operational shortcomings, but \nexcludes business and reputational risk. \nCivil Litigation provisions arise out of current or potential claims or proceedings alleging non-compliance with contractual \nor other legal or regulatory responsibilities, which have resulted or may result in demands from customers, counterparties \nor other parties in civil litigations. \nRegulatory Enforcement provisions arise out of current or potential claims or proceedings alleging non-compliance with \nlegal or regulatory responsibilities, which have resulted or may result in an assessment of fines or penalties by \ngovernmental regulatory agencies, self-regulatory organizations or other enforcement authorities.  \nRestructuring provisions arise out of restructuring activities. The Group aims to enhance its long-term competitiveness \nthrough major reductions in costs, duplication and complexity in the years ahead. For details see Note 10 “Restructuring”. \nOther provisions include several specific items arising from a variety of different circumstances, including the provision for \nthe reimbursement of loan processing fees, deferred sales commissions, provisions for bank levies and mortgage \nrepurchase demands. \nProvisions and Contingent Liabilities \nThe Group recognizes a provision for potential loss only when there is a present obligation arising from a past event that is \nprobable to result in an economic outflow that can be reliably estimated. Where a reliable estimate cannot be made for \nsuch an obligation, no provision is recognized and the obligation is deemed a contingent liability. Contingent liabilities also \ninclude possible obligations for which the possibility of future economic outflow is more than remote but less than \nprobable. Where a provision has been taken for a particular claim, no contingent liability is recorded; for matters or sets of \nmatters consisting of more than one claim, however, provisions may be recorded for some claims, and contingent liabilities \n(or neither a provision nor a contingent liability) may be recorded for others. \nThe Group operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to significant litigation risks. As a result, the \nGroup is involved in litigation, arbitration and regulatory proceedings and investigations in Germany and in a number of \njurisdictions outside Germany, including the United States. In recent years, regulation and supervision in a number of areas \nhave increased, and regulators, governmental bodies and others have sought to subject financial services providers to \nincreasing oversight and scrutiny, which in turn has led to additional regulatory investigations and enforcement actions \nwhich are often followed by civil litigation.  \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 510, "text": " \n \n478  \nDeutsche Bank  \nNotes to the consolidated balance sheet \nAnnual Report 2024 \n27 – Provisions \nIn determining for which of the claims the possibility of a loss is probable, or less than probable but more than remote, and \nthen estimating the possible loss for those claims, the Group takes into consideration a number of factors, including but \nnot limited to the nature of the claim and its underlying facts, the procedural posture and litigation history of each case, \nrulings by the courts or tribunals, the Group’s experience and the experience of others in similar cases (to the extent this is \nknown to the Group), prior settlement discussions, settlements by others in similar cases (to the extent this is known to the \nGroup), available indemnities and the opinions and views of legal counsel and other experts.  \nThe provisions the Group has recognized for civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters as of December 31, 2024 \nand December 31, 2023 are set forth in the table above. For some matters where the Group believes an outflow of funds \nis probable, but the Group could not reliably estimate the amount of the potential outflow, no provision was recognized. \nFor the matters for which a reliable estimate can be made, but the probability of a future loss or outflow of resources is \nmore than remote but less than probable, the Group currently estimates that, as of December 31, 2024, these contingent \nliabilities are approximately € 0.6 billion for civil litigation matters (December 31, 2023: € 1.9 billion) and € 0.1 billion for \nregulatory enforcement matters (December 31, 2023: € 0.2 billion). These figures include matters where the Group’s \npotential liability is joint and several and where the Group expects any such liability to be paid by a third party. If the Group’s \nbest estimate is within a range, the amount at the top of the range is included in the amount of contingent liabilities.  \nFor other significant civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters where the Group believes the possibility of an \noutflow of funds is more than remote but less than probable, but the amount is not reliably estimable, such matters are \nnot included in the contingent liability estimates. In addition, where the Group believes the possibility of an outflow of \nfunds is remote, the Group has neither recognized a provision nor included the matters in the contingent liability estimates.  \nThis estimated possible loss, as well as any provisions taken, is based upon currently available information and is subject \nto significant judgment and a variety of assumptions, variables and known and unknown uncertainties. These uncertainties \nmay include inaccuracies in or incompleteness of the information available to the Group, particularly at the preliminary \nstages of matters, and assumptions by the Group as to future rulings of courts or other tribunals or the likely actions or \npositions taken by regulators or adversaries may prove incorrect. Moreover, estimates of possible loss for these matters \nare often not amenable to the use of statistical or other quantitative analytical tools frequently used in making judgments \nand estimates, and are subject to even greater degrees of uncertainty than in many other areas where the Group must \nexercise judgment and make estimates. The estimated possible loss, as well as any provisions taken, can be and often are \nsubstantially less than the amount initially requested by regulators or adversaries or the maximum potential loss that could \nbe incurred were the matters to result in a final adjudication adverse to the Group. Moreover, in several regions in which \nthe Group operates, an adversary often is not required to set forth the amount it is seeking, and where it is, the amount \nmay not be subject to the same requirements that generally apply to pleading factual allegations or legal claims. \nThe matters for which the Group determines that the possibility of a future loss is more than remote will change from time \nto time, as will the matters as to which a reliable estimate can be made and the estimated possible loss for such matters. \nActual results may prove to be significantly higher or lower than the estimate of possible loss in those matters where such \nan estimate was made. In addition, loss may be incurred in matters with respect to which the Group believed the likelihood \nof loss was remote. In particular, the estimated aggregate possible loss does not represent the Group’s potential maximum \nloss exposure for those matters.  \nThe Group may settle litigation or regulatory proceedings or investigations prior to a final judgment or determination of \nliability. It may do so to avoid the cost, management efforts or negative business, regulatory or reputational consequences \nof continuing to contest liability, even when the Group believes it has a valid defense against liability. It may also do so \nwhen the potential consequences of failing to prevail would be disproportionate to the costs of settlement. Furthermore, \nthe Group may, for similar reasons, reimburse counterparties for their losses even in situations where it does not believe \nthat it is legally compelled to do so. \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 511, "text": " \n \n479  \nDeutsche Bank  \nNotes to the consolidated balance sheet \nAnnual Report 2024 \n27 – Provisions \nCurrent Individual Proceedings  \nSet forth below are descriptions of civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters or groups of matters for which the \nGroup has taken material provisions, or for which there are material contingent liabilities, or for which there is the possibility \nof material business or reputational risk, as well as other significant matters. In addition, similar matters are grouped \ntogether and some matters consist of a number of proceedings or claims. The disclosed matters also include matters for \nwhich the possibility of a loss is more than remote but for which the Group cannot reliably estimate the possible loss. \nMatters are presented below in English-language alphabetical order based on the titles the Group has used for them. \nConsent Order and Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve. On July 19, 2023, Deutsche Bank, Deutsche Bank AG \nNew York Branch, DB USA Corporation, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (DBTCA) and DWS USA Corporation \nentered into a Consent Order and Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve resolving previously disclosed regulatory \ndiscussions concerning adherence to prior orders and settlements related to sanctions and embargoes and AML \ncompliance, and remedial agreements and obligations related to risk management issues. The Consent Order alleges \ninsufficient and tardy implementation of the post-settlement sanctions and embargoes and AML control enhancement \nundertakings required by prior Consent Orders the bank entered into with the Federal Reserve in 2015 and 2017. The \nWritten Agreement alleges various deficiencies in governance, risk management, and internal controls across the bank’s \nU.S. operations, and finds that the bank must continue to implement additional improvements. The Consent Order requires \nDeutsche Bank to pay a civil monetary penalty of U.S. $ 186 million, including U.S. $ 140 million for the violations alleged \nwith respect to the post-settlement sanctions and embargoes and AML control enhancement undertakings, as well as a \nseparate penalty of U.S. $ 46 million for unsafe or unsound practices stemming from the bank’s handling of its legacy \ncorrespondent banking relationship with Danske Bank Estonia, which was terminated in October 2015. The Written \nAgreement does not include a civil monetary penalty. Both the Consent Order and Written Agreement include certain \npost-settlement remediation and reporting undertakings. \nCum-ex Investigations and Litigations. Deutsche Bank has received inquiries from law enforcement authorities, including \nrequests for information and documents, in relation to cum-ex transactions of clients. “Cum-ex” refers to trading activities \nin German shares around dividend record dates (trade date before and settlement date after dividend record date) for the \npurpose of obtaining German tax credits or refunds in relation to withholding tax levied on dividend payments, including \ntransaction structures that have resulted in more than one market participant claiming such credit or refund with respect \nto the same dividend payment. Cum-ex transactions are regarded as criminal tax evasion by German courts. Deutsche Bank \nis cooperating with the law enforcement authorities in these matters. \nThe Public Prosecutor in Cologne (Staatsanwaltschaft Köln, “CPP”) has been conducting a criminal investigation since \nAugust 2017 concerning two former employees of Deutsche Bank in relation to cum-ex transactions of certain former \nclients of the bank. In October 2022, the CPP conducted a search at Deutsche Bank’s offices in Frankfurt and Eschborn. \nBased on the search warrant the CPP expanded the scope of the investigation. Current and former Deutsche Bank \nemployees and seven former Management Board members are included in the investigation. The investigation is still at an \nearly stage and the scope of the investigation may be further broadened. Deutsche Bank is a potential secondary \nparticipant pursuant to Section 30 of the German Law on Administrative Offences in this proceeding. This proceeding \ncould result in a disgorgement of profits and fines. Deutsche Bank is cooperating with the CPP. \nIn May 2021, Deutsche Bank learned through an information request received by Deutsche Oppenheim Family Office AG \n(DOAG) as legal successor of Sal. Oppenheim jr. & Cie. AG & Co. KGaA (Sal. Oppenheim) that the CPP in 2021 opened a \ncriminal investigation proceeding in relation to cum-ex transactions against unknown former personnel of Sal. Oppenheim. \nDOAG provided the requested information. \nOn July 12, 2023, Deutsche Bank as legal successor of Deutsche Postbank AG was informed by the CPP that the CPP has \nopened a new separate criminal cum-ex investigation against unnamed personnel of former Deutsche Postbank AG. \nDeutsche Bank acted as participant in and filed withholding tax refund claims through the electronic refund procedure \n(elektronisches Datenträgerverfahren) on behalf of, inter alia, two former custody clients in connection with their cum-ex \ntransactions. In February 2018, Deutsche Bank received from the German Federal Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für \nSteuern, “FTO”) a demand of approximately € 49.0 million for tax refunds paid to a former custody client. Deutsche Bank \nexpects to receive a formal notice for the same amount. In December 2019, Deutsche Bank received a liability notice from \nthe FTO requesting payment of € 2.1 million in connection with tax refund claims Deutsche Bank had submitted on behalf \nof another former custody client, which Deutsche Bank paid in early 2020. In July 2022, Deutsche Bank filed an action \nagainst this payment with the Fiscal Court of Cologne (Finanzgericht Köln). \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 512, "text": " \n \n480  \nDeutsche Bank  \nNotes to the consolidated balance sheet \nAnnual Report 2024 \n27 – Provisions \nIn 2018, The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV (BNY) informed Deutsche Bank of its intention to seek indemnification for \npotential cum-ex related tax liabilities incurred by BHF Asset Servicing GmbH (BAS) and/or Frankfurter Service \nKapitalanlage-GmbH (“Service KAG”, now named BNY Mellon Service Kapitalanlage-Gesellschaft mbH). Deutsche Bank \nhad acquired BAS and Service KAG as part of the acquisition of Sal. Oppenheim in 2010 and sold them to BNY later that \nyear. BNY estimated the potential tax liability to be up to € 120.0 million (excluding interest of 6% p.a.). In late 2020, \ncounsel to BNY informed Deutsche Bank that BNY and/or Service KAG (among others) have received notices from tax \nauthorities in the estimated amount with respect to cum-ex related trades by certain investment funds in 2009 and 2010. \nBNY has filed objections against the notices. Following receipt of payment orders from tax authorities in the amount of \n€ 118.3 million in relation to the investment funds and after consultation with Deutsche Bank, BNY paid € 53.6 million to \ntax authorities. A further € 50.9 million were originally paid by third parties. In addition, BNY received from the Frankfurt \nTax Office regarding one of the investment funds a notice and payment request regarding penalty interest \n(Hinterziehungszinsen) in the amount of € 11.6 million. BNY, after consultation with Deutsche Bank, applied for a \nsuspension of enforcement (Aussetzung der Vollziehung) regarding the payment request which was granted by the Fiscal \nCourt of Hesse (Hessisches Finanzgericht) in October 2024. In 2025, BNY informed Deutsche Bank that it has received a \nrepayment of € 2.5 million due to a payment in 2024 by a further third party in relation to one of the investment funds. \nIn December 2023 and April 2024, Deutsche Bank received hearing letters from the FTO regarding three third party \ninvestment funds that engaged in cum-ex trades in 2009. Deutsche Bank had provided services and financing to investors \nin the funds. The funds received an aggregate of € 147 million in cum-ex withholding tax refunds in 2009. In February 2024, \nDeutsche Bank responded to the first two hearing letters. In June and July 2024, Deutsche Bank received two tax liability \nnotices (Haftungsbescheide) from the FTO in an aggregate amount of € 85 million regarding two of the funds. Deutsche \nBank filed objections (Einsprüche) and applied for a suspension of enforcement (Aussetzung der Vollziehung) regarding the \nnotices. The suspension of enforcement was granted in July 2024. \nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters \nbecause it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome. \nFX Derivatives Products Investigations and Litigation. Following an internal investigation into the historical sales of certain \nFX derivatives products, Deutsche Bank is providing information to and otherwise cooperating with its regulators. In \nDecember 2023, the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) announced it will initiate proceedings against \nDeutsche Bank, S.A.E. for advisory services provided to Spanish clients in relation to FX derivative products. In January \n2025, the CNMV concluded those proceedings and issued a fine of € 10 million against DB S.A.E. and a one year suspension \nof advisory services by DB S.A.E. relating to complex OTC derivative transactions with embedded complex FX structures. \nDB S.A.E. has filed an appeal with the Spanish courts. Separately, in September 2021, Deutsche Bank was served with a \nclaim that was filed in the High Court of England and Wales by four companies within the Palladium Hotels Group (PHG). \nPHG claimed restitution or damages for alleged losses estimated at € 500 million in respect of FX derivatives trades \nentered into with Deutsche Bank between 2013 and 2019. They alleged that the trades were mis-sold by Deutsche Bank \nand that one of the four PHG claimants lacked legal capacity to enter into some of the trades. Deutsche Bank filed a \ndefense disputing the claim. In January 2024, PHG filed amended pleadings to include additional allegations of fraudulent \nmisrepresentation. Deutsche Bank filed an amended defense in February 2024 which disputed the new allegations. \nDeutsche Bank and PHG agreed a full and final settlement of the claim on confidential terms and the High Court \nproceedings were dismissed in July 2024. \nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters \nbecause it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome. \nFX Investigations and Litigations. Deutsche Bank has received requests for information from certain regulatory and law \nenforcement agencies globally who investigated trading in, and various other aspects of, the foreign exchange market.  \nDeutsche Bank has been named as a defendant in an amended and consolidated class action filed in Israel. This action \nalleges a conspiracy among traders at 16 banks to manipulate FX benchmark rates and to widen FX currency pair spreads \nin the period 2003 to 2013 and seeks damages pursuant to Israeli antitrust law as well as other causes of action. This action \nis in preliminary stages. \nIn May 2021, Deutsche Bank S.A. – Banco Alemao was named in a civil antitrust action brought in the São Paulo Civil Court \nof Central Jurisdiction by the Association of Brazilian Exporters (AEB) against certain FX dealers and affiliated financial \ninstitutions in Brazil. This action asserts factual allegations based on conduct investigated by the Brazilian competition \nauthority, CADE, and seeks damages pursuant to Brazilian antitrust law. In February 2022, the presiding judge dismissed \nthe action on the basis that the action was not appropriate for a class proceeding. AEB has appealed the decision. Deutsche \nBank has not yet been served.  \nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters \nbecause it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 513, "text": " \n \n481  \nDeutsche Bank  \nNotes to the consolidated balance sheet \nAnnual Report 2024 \n27 – Provisions \nInterbank and Dealer Offered Rates Matters. Regulatory and Law Enforcement Matters. Deutsche Bank has responded to \nrequests for information from, and cooperated with, various regulatory and law enforcement agencies, in connection with \nindustry-wide investigations concerning the setting of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Euro Interbank Offered \nRate (EURIBOR), Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) and other interbank and/or dealer offered rates.  \nFrom 2013 through 2017, Deutsche Bank entered into settlements with the European Commission, the U.S. Department \nof Justice (DOJ), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the \nNew York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) and other regulators with respect to interbank and dealer offered \nrates matters. Other investigations of Deutsche Bank concerning the setting of various interbank and/or dealer offered \nrates remain ongoing.  \nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to the remaining \ninvestigations because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome.  \nCivil Litigations. Deutsche Bank is party to three U.S. civil actions concerning alleged manipulation relating to the setting \nof U.S. dollar LIBOR, as well as actions pending in the UK, Argentina and Spain. The Group has not disclosed whether it has \nestablished a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters because it has concluded that such disclosure \ncan be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome.  \nThe U.S. civil actions were filed against Deutsche Bank and numerous other defendants on behalf of parties who allege \nlosses as a result of manipulation relating to the setting of U.S. dollar LIBOR. Claims for damages for all three of the U.S. \ncivil actions discussed have been asserted under various legal theories, including violations of federal and state antitrust \nand other laws.  \nTwo of the three U.S. civil actions concerning U.S. dollar LIBOR are being coordinated as part of a multidistrict litigation \n(the “U.S. dollar LIBOR MDL”) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY). Following a series of \ndecisions in the U.S. dollar LIBOR MDL between March 2013 and March 2019 narrowing their claims, plaintiffs in the U.S. \nDollar LIBOR MDL are currently asserting antitrust claims, claims under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act and U.S. \nSecurities Exchange Act and state law fraud, contract, unjust enrichment and other tort claims. The court has also issued \ndecisions dismissing certain plaintiffs’ claims for lack of personal jurisdiction and on statute of limitations grounds.  \nIn 2016, the district court issued a ruling dismissing certain antitrust claims while allowing others to proceed. Multiple \nplaintiffs filed appeals of that ruling. In December 2021, the Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision on \nantitrust standing grounds but reversed the court’s decision on personal jurisdiction grounds, and it remanded the cases \nto the district court for further proceedings. In March 2022, defendants (including Deutsche Bank) filed a petition for a writ \nof certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals’ decision. The U.S. Supreme Court denied \ndefendants’ petition in June 2022. \nOn October 4, 2024, defendants, including Deutsche Bank, filed a motion for summary judgment in the U.S. dollar LIBOR \nMDL. The motion is now fully briefed and awaiting decision. \nIn August 2020, plaintiffs filed a non-class action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against \nseveral financial institutions, alleging that U.S. dollar LIBOR has been suppressed through the present. In September 2022, \nthe court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss, but granted plaintiffs leave to amend. Later in 2022, the plaintiffs \nfiled an amended complaint, and the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which the court granted \nin October 2023. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and an \namended notice of appeal in November 2023. Plaintiffs filed their appeal brief on January 25, 2024, and defendants filed \ntheir appeal brief on March 25, 2024. The Court affirmed the district court’s decision dismissing the complaint on \nDecember 9, 2024. On December 23, 2024, plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing. On January 22, 2025, the Court denied \nplaintiffs’ petition for rehearing. \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 514, "text": " \n \n482  \nDeutsche Bank  \nNotes to the consolidated balance sheet \nAnnual Report 2024 \n27 – Provisions \nThere is a further UK civil action regarding U.S. dollar LIBOR brought by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \n(FDIC) acting as receiver for 19 failed financial institutions headquartered in the U.S., in which a claim for damages has \nbeen asserted pursuant to EU, UK and U.S. state laws. In February 2022, following a ruling issued by the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit in relation to USD LIBOR antitrust claims, the UK LIBOR proceedings were stayed until July \n2022, to allow for clarification of the position in relation to the parallel proceedings brought by the FDIC against Deutsche \nBank in the U.S. The FDIC filed an application to reinstate proceedings in the United States in July 2022. Following the \nexpiration of the UK stay, at a case management conference that took place in December 2022, the UK court ordered a \ntrial of a sample of three of the failed financial institutions. This ‘sample bank’ trial has been listed for a 19-week trial in \nFebruary 2026. In December 2022, the SDNY granted the FDIC’s application to reinstate certain of its claims against \nDeutsche Bank (and the other foreign defendants) in the U.S. to the extent these claims survived a motion to dismiss on \nthe merits and subject to defendants’ reservation of rights to dispute the claims in the future. \nA further class action regarding LIBOR has been filed in Argentina seeking damages for losses allegedly suffered by holders \nof Argentine bonds with interest rates based on LIBOR. On August 16, 2024, the court accepted the plaintiff’s withdrawal \nof its claims against Deutsche Bank and certain other defendants, but the action remains pending against one defendant. \nJeffrey Epstein Matters. In December 2018, Deutsche Bank began the process to terminate its client relationship with \nJeffrey Epstein, which began in August 2013. Since Epstein’s arrest in July 2019, Deutsche Bank provided information to \nand cooperated with various regulatory and law enforcement agencies concerning the bank’s former client relationship \nwith Epstein (individually, and through related parties and entities) and entered into settlements to resolve certain \nregulatory and litigation matters. In addition, as noted below, a more recent Epstein matter against Deutsche Bank was \ndiscontinued with prejudice. \nOn November 23, 2023, Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, and DBTCA were named as defendants \nin a complaint filed in New York State Supreme Court by an alleged victim of Epstein. The complaint, amended on \nDecember 31, 2023, contained the same Trafficking Victims Protection Act and New York law claims that had been \nasserted against the bank in a recently settled class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the SDNY. On April 8, \n2024, the plaintiff discontinued all claims against Deutsche Bank with prejudice. \nMonte Dei Paschi. In November 2019, the Court of First Instance of Milan convicted five former Deutsche Bank employees \nand one then-current employee of aiding and abetting false accounting and market manipulation in relation to repo \ntransactions that Deutsche Bank had entered into with Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS) and a subsidiary of MPS in \n2008. The individuals were given sentences of either 3 years and 6 months or 4 years and 8 months. Deutsche Bank was \nfound liable under Italian Legislative Decree n. 231/2001 and the Court ordered the seizure of alleged profits of \n€ 64.9 million and a fine of € 3 million. The Court also found Deutsche Bank had civil vicarious liability for damages (to be \nquantified) as an employer of the employees who were convicted. The sentences and fines were not due until the \nconclusion of any appeal process. Following appeals filed by Deutsche Bank and the six Deutsche Bank individuals, in 2022, \nthe Milan Court of Appeal acquitted all the Deutsche Bank defendants from all charges. The Public Prosecutor filed an \nappeal against the Milan Court of Appeal verdicts before the Supreme Court in November 2022. In October 2023, the \nSupreme Court declared the Public Prosecutor’s appeal inadmissible and confirmed the acquittal decisions of the Milan \nCourt of Appeal, which are now therefore final.  \nIn May 2018, CONSOB, the authority responsible for regulating the Italian financial markets, issued fines of € 100,000 each \nagainst the six Deutsche Bank individuals who were defendants in the criminal proceedings. The six individuals were also \nbanned from performing management functions in Italy and for Italian based institutions for three to six months each. No \nseparate fine or sanction was imposed on Deutsche Bank, but it is jointly and severally liable for the six Deutsche Bank \nindividuals’ fines. In June 2018, Deutsche Bank and the six individuals filed an appeal in the Milan Court of Appeal \nchallenging CONSOB’s decision. In December 2020, the Milan Court of Appeal allowed the appeals filed by Deutsche Bank \nand the six individuals and annulled the resolution sanctioning them. In June 2021, CONSOB filed an appeal to the \nSupreme Court against the Court of Appeal’s decision but withdrew its appeal in November 2024 following the full \nacquittal of the six individuals from criminal charges brought against them. As a result, the decision of the Milan Court of \nAppeal is now final and binding.  \nFinally, in the second quarter of 2024, a former Deutsche Bank employee filed and served a claim against it in the German \nCourts, seeking approximately € 152 million in damages for alleged harm caused to his career by the Italian criminal \nproceedings and conviction at first instance. The five other Deutsche Bank individuals from the criminal proceedings have \nalso threatened to bring their own such claims in the English Courts. Deutsche Bank considers all such claims to be entirely \nwithout merit and will defend itself against them robustly, including disputing inflated, unrealistic alleged losses such as \nthe figure claimed in Germany. \nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters \nbecause it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome. \n"}

The Group has recorded \nprovisions with respect to several of these civil cases, but has not recorded provisions with respect to all of these matters. \nThe Group has not disclosed the amount of these provisions because it has concluded that such disclosure can be \nexpected to prejudice seriously the resolution of these matters. \nDeutsche Bank is a defendant in an action related to RMBS offerings brought by the FDIC as receiver for Citizens National \nBank and Strategic Capital Bank (alleging an unspecified amount in damages against all defendants). In this action, the \nappellate court reinstated claims previously dismissed on statute of limitations grounds, and petitions for rehearing and \ncertiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court were denied. In May 2022, the FDIC voluntarily dismissed its claim with respect to one \nof the RMBS offerings and Deutsche Bank filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of the remaining claim. \nDeutsche Bank's motion has been fully briefed as of July 2022. Discovery is stayed pending resolution of Deutsche Bank's \nmotion. \nDeutsche Bank is a defendant in cases concerning two RMBS trusts that were brought initially by RMBS investors and \nsubsequently by HSBC, as trustee, in New York state court. The cases allege breaches of Deutsche Bank’s purported duty \nto notify the trustee of breaches of loan-level representations and warranties in the ACE Securities Corp. 2006-FM1 and \nACE Securities Corp. 2007-ASAP1 RMBS offerings, respectively. The cases originally asserted claims against Deutsche \nBank for breaches of representations and warranties, but those claims were dismissed as untimely, and the appellate court \naffirmed in April 2019. Discovery is ongoing.  \nIn October 2019, plaintiffs filed two complaints (one by HSBC as trustee and one by certificate holders) seeking to revive, \nunder Section 205(a) of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, the untimely breach of representations and warranties \nclaims as to which dismissal was affirmed in the case concerning ACE Securities Corp. 2006-FM1. The trial court dismissed \nthe certificate holder action, and the First Department affirmed in 2022. The certificate holders filed a motion for leave to \nappeal to the Court of Appeals, which was denied on February 20, 2024. The trial court also dismissed the trustee revival \naction filed by HSBC. In November 2022, HSBC filed an appeal, which it ultimately withdrew on March 18, 2024.  \nIn the actions against Deutsche Bank solely as an underwriter of other issuers’ RMBS offerings, Deutsche Bank has \ncontractual rights to indemnification from the issuers, but those indemnity rights may in whole or in part prove effectively \nunenforceable where the issuers are now or may in the future be in bankruptcy or otherwise defunct.  \nMortgage-Related and Asset-Backed Securities – Trustee Civil Litigation. Deutsche Bank’s U.S. subsidiaries Deutsche Bank \nNational Trust Company (DBNTC) and DBTCA (collectively, the “Trustees”) are defendants in two separate civil lawsuits, \nand DBNTC is a defendant in a third civil lawsuit, brought by investors concerning the Trustees’ role as trustees of certain \nRMBS trusts. The actions generally allege claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of the duty to \navoid conflicts of interest, negligence and/or violations of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, based on the Trustees’ \nalleged failure to perform adequately certain obligations and/or duties as trustee for the trusts.  \nThe three lawsuits include actions by (a) the National Credit Union Administration Board (NCUA), as an investor in 18 trusts \nthat allegedly suffered total realized collateral losses of more than U.S. $ 3.7 billion; (b) Commerzbank AG, as an investor \nin 50 RMBS trusts, alleging hundreds of millions of dollars in losses; and (c) IKB International, S.A. in liquidation and IKB \nDeutsche Industriebank A.G. (collectively, “IKB”), as an investor in 12 RMBS trusts, originally seeking more than U.S. \n$ 268 million of damages before IKB voluntarily discontinued its claims as to certain RMBS certificates. In the NCUA case, \nDBNTC’s motion to dismiss the amended complaint was granted in part and denied in part, dismissing NCUA’s tort claims \nbut preserving its breach-of-contract claims. Both parties filed motions for partial summary judgment, and those motions \nare fully briefed and pending before the court. In February 2022, the court in the Commerzbank case granted in part and \ndenied in part DBNTC’s and DBTCA’s motion for summary judgment, dismissing all of the tort claims and dismissing the \nbreach of contract claims relating to certain of the trusts, and denied Commerzbank’s motion for summary judgment in its \nentirety. A second round of summary judgment briefing was completed on January 23, 2025. In January 2021, the court in \nthe IKB case granted in part and denied in part the Trustees’ motion to dismiss, dismissing certain of IKB’s claims but \nallowing certain of its breach of contract and tort claims to go forward; the Trustees appealed certain aspects of that order, \nand IKB cross-appealed with respect to other aspects. In August 2022, the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, \nFirst Department, affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court’s order on the motion to dismiss. DBNTC and DBTCA \nappealed certain aspects of the First Department’s decision. In June 2023, the New York Court of Appeals modified the \nFirst Department’s decision in part, dismissing certain additional contract claims and IKB’s remaining tort claims. The \noperative scheduling order contemplates that summary judgment briefing will be completed by March 20, 2025. \n"}

Starting in 2016, certain clients of Deutsche Bank Polska S.A. have reached out to Deutsche Bank \nPolska S.A. alleging that their mortgage loan agreements in foreign currency include unfair clauses and are invalid. These \nclients have demanded reimbursement of the alleged overpayments under such agreements totaling over € 864 million \nwith over  6,645 civil claims having been commenced in Polish courts as of December 31, 2024. These cases are an \nindustry-wide issue in Poland and other banks are facing similar claims. Deutsche Bank Polska S.A. has and will take \nnecessary legal actions to defend itself and challenge such claims in courts.  \nDuring 2023, there was a deterioration in the risk profile with respect to the Polish FX mortgage portfolio, especially \nfollowing an adverse decision by the European Court of Justice on June 15, 2023, which affected the broader Polish \nbanking sector. In addition, the bank refined its model for estimating the provision in the third quarter of 2023 for the \nexpected development of court verdicts and other market parameters.  \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, as part of the annual model review and quarterly provisioning review, the Bank refined \nthe model-based estimate with additional data points (e.g., latest claim information, loss ratio, court settlements as well \nas expected number of claims), which resulted in an increase in the provision of € 317 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the provision increased by € 475 million, resulting in a total portfolio provision for \nCHF and EUR mortgage cases of € 895 million as of December 31, 2024 compared to € 534 million as of December 31, \n2023. \nPostbank Voluntary Public Takeover Offer. In September 2010, Deutsche Bank announced the decision to make a \nvoluntary takeover offer for the acquisition of all shares in Deutsche Postbank AG (\"Postbank\"). On October 7, 2010, \nDeutsche Bank published its official takeover offer and offered Postbank shareholders a consideration of € 25  for each \nPostbank share. This offer was accepted for a total of approximately  48.2 million Postbank shares. \nSeveral former shareholders of Postbank who had accepted the takeover offer brought claims against Deutsche Bank \nalleging that the offer price was too low. The plaintiffs allege that Deutsche Bank had been obliged to make a mandatory \ntakeover offer for all shares in Postbank, at the latest, in 2009. Based thereon, the plaintiffs allege that the consideration \noffered by Deutsche Bank for the shares in Postbank needed to be raised to € 57.25  or even € 64.25  per share.  \nThe claims for payment against Deutsche Bank in relation to these matters originally amounted to almost € 700 million \n(excluding interest, which would be significant due to the long duration of the proceedings).  \nAt the end of April 2024, the Higher Regional Court of Cologne indicated in a hearing that it may find these claims valid in \na later ruling. As a consequence, Deutsche Bank recognized a provision of € 1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2024 to \nprovide for the amount of all pending claims and cumulative interest. \nIn the third quarter of 2024, Deutsche Bank reached settlement agreements as regards more than 60% of the plaintiff \nclaims by value in the litigation (calculated based on the asserted shareholdings) which resulted in a partial release of the \noriginal provision. As of December 31, 2024 a provision of € 550 million remains in place for the outstanding plaintiff claims \nas of December 31, 2024. \nOn October 23, 2024, the Higher Regional Court of Cologne handed down its judgment in the remaining lead case and \nfully granted the plaintiffs' claims. The court did not grant a further leave to appeal to the Federal Court of Justice (BGH). \nOn November 19, 2024, Deutsche Bank filed a complaint against the denial of leave to appeal with the BGH. \nThe legal question of whether Deutsche Bank had been obliged to make a mandatory takeover offer for all Postbank shares \nprior to its 2010 voluntary takeover may impact two pending appraisal proceedings (Spruchverfahren). These proceedings \nwere initiated by former Postbank shareholders with the aim to increase the cash compensation of € 35.05 paid in \nconnection with the squeeze-out of Postbank shareholders in 2015 and the cash compensation of € 25.18 offered and \nannual compensation of € 1.66  paid in connection with the execution of a domination and profit and loss transfer \nagreement (Beherrschungs- und Gewinnabführungsvertrag) between DB Finanz-Holding AG (now DB Beteiligungs-\nHolding GmbH) and Postbank in 2012. The compensation of € 25.18 in connection with the domination and profit and loss \ntransfer agreement was accepted for approximately  0.5 million Postbank shares. The compensation of € 35.05 paid in \nconnection with the squeeze-out in 2015 was relevant for approximately  7 million Postbank shares. \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 517, "text": " \n \n485  \nDeutsche Bank  \nNotes to the consolidated balance sheet \nAnnual Report 2024 \n27 – Provisions \nThe applicants in the appraisal proceedings claim that a potential obligation of Deutsche Bank to make a mandatory \ntakeover offer for Postbank at an offer price of at least € 57.25 should be decisive when determining the adequate cash \ncompensation in the appraisal proceedings. The Regional Court Cologne had originally followed this legal view of the \napplicants in two resolutions. In a decision dated June 2019, the Regional Court Cologne expressly gave up this legal view \nin the appraisal proceedings in connection with the execution of a domination and profit and loss transfer agreement. \nAccording to this decision, the question whether Deutsche Bank was obliged to make a mandatory offer for all Postbank \nshares prior to its voluntary takeover offer in 2010 shall not be relevant for determining the appropriate cash \ncompensation. It is likely that the Regional Court Cologne will take the same legal position in the appraisal proceedings in \nconnection with the squeeze-out.  \nOn October 1, 2020, the Regional Court Cologne handed down a decision in the appraisal proceeding concerning the \ndomination and profit and loss transfer agreement (dated December 5, 2012) according to which the annual compensation \npursuant to Sec. 304 of the German Stock Corporation Act (jährliche Ausgleichszahlung) shall be increased by € 0.12  to \n€ 1.78  per Postbank share and the settlement amount pursuant to Sec. 305 of the German Stock Corporation Act \n(Abfindungsbetrag) shall be increased by € 4.56 to € 29.74 per Postbank share. The increase of the settlement amount is \nof relevance for approximately 0.5 million former Postbank shares whereas the increase of the annual compensation is of \nrelevance for approximately  7 million former Postbank shares. Deutsche Bank as well as the applicants have lodged an \nappeal against this decision. \nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to the appraisal \nproceedings because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously its outcome. \nRusChemAlliance Litigation. In June 2023, RusChemAlliance LLC (\"RCA\"), a Russian joint venture of Gazprom PJSC and \nRusGasDobycha JSC, filed a claim against Deutsche Bank before a commercial state court in Saint Petersburg seeking \npayment of approximately € 238 million plus interest under an advance payment guarantee (\"APG\") issued by Deutsche \nBank in 2021 at the request of one of its clients. RCA’s payment demand under the APG was rejected by Deutsche Bank \ndue to the imposition of EU sanctions against Russia. At the end of May 2024, the Russian court fully granted RCA's \npayment claim and RCA's motion for interim measures by which a corresponding amount in Deutsche Bank's Russian \nsubsidiary was frozen as the Russian courts do not recognize the applicability of the EU sanctions. Deutsche Bank’s appeals \nagainst this decision were dismissed in September 2024 and January 2025, respectively.  \nOn October 23, 2024, upon application by RCA, the Russian court granted an anti-suit injunction (“ASI”) order against \nDeutsche Bank prohibiting Deutsche Bank from continuing any court proceedings outside of Russia related to this issue or \nenforcing any judgments or orders granted by a court outside of Russia under a threat of a court penalty of € 240 million \nin case of non-compliance with the ASI. Deutsche Bank complied with the ASI order in November 2024. Deutsche Bank’s \nappeal against the ASI order was dismissed in January 2025. \nDeutsche Bank initially recognized a provision in the amount of € 260 million and a corresponding reimbursement asset \nunder an indemnification agreement in 2023. The expense from the recognition of the provision was offset by the income \nfrom the initial recognition of the reimbursement asset. On November 15, 2024, RCA enforced its payment claim in an \namount of € 244 million including interest payable against assets of Deutsche Bank maintained in Russia. After \nenforcement by RCA, which was covered by the provision, subsequent developments led to a de-recognition of the \nindemnification asset as receipt of payment can no longer be viewed as virtually certain. Deutsche Bank is of the opinion \nthat it is in possession of a valid indemnification claim and will defend its position in court. \nSovereign, Supranational and Agency Bonds (SSA) Investigations and Litigations. Deutsche Bank has received inquiries \nfrom certain regulatory and law enforcement authorities, including requests for information and documents, pertaining to \nSSA bond trading. Deutsche Bank is cooperating with these investigations. \nOn May 24, 2023, the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) sent a statement of objections to Deutsche Bank \nregarding a potential breach of United Kingdom antitrust rules in relation to the sale, secondary market trading and buy-\nback auctions of United Kingdom government bonds, which includes Gilts and Gilt asset swaps, between 2009 and 2013. \nDeutsche Bank proactively cooperated with the CMA in this matter and as a result was granted full provisional immunity. \nOn February 21, 2025, the CMA issued its final decisions against Deutsche Bank and four other banks in relation to this \ninvestigation, finding breaches of UK antitrust rules on specific dates in the period 2009 to 2013. No fine was imposed on \nDeutsche Bank as the CMA confirmed it had full immunity as it has alerted the CMA to this matter. \nOn November 22, 2023, the European Commission announced its decision that Deutsche Bank and one other bank in the \npast breached EU antitrust rules in relation to secondary market trading of Euro-denominated SSA bonds, and to a very \nlimited extent government guaranteed bonds. Deutsche Bank has proactively cooperated with the European Commission \nin this matter and, as a result, has been granted full immunity. In accordance with the European Commission’s guidelines, \nno financial penalty was imposed on Deutsche Bank. The timeframe of the alleged infringement ended in 2016. \n"}

The complaint seeks treble damages and attorneys’ fees. On \nSeptember 13, 2024, the Court granted Deutsche Bank’s motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. The \nplaintiff must seek leave of the Court to amend the complaint or the case will be dismissed with prejudice. \nDeutsche Bank was named as a defendant in a putative class action filed in December 2022 in the U.S. District Court for \nthe SDNY by alleged direct market participants claiming a violation of antitrust law related to alleged manipulation of the \nsecondary trading market for Euro-denominated Sovereign bonds. On August 26, 2024, the Court granted Deutsche \nBank’s motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.

The complaints seek compensatory and punitive damages. On July 20, \n2022, Deutsche Bank entered into a national settlement agreement that would resolve the Canadian Federal SSA claim \nagainst all Deutsche Bank defendants. The Federal Court of Canada approved the settlement on November 15, 2024. \nDeutsche Bank was named as a defendant in a consolidated putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the \nSDNY alleging violations of U.S. antitrust law and a claim for unjust enrichment relating to Mexican government bond \ntrading. Defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ consolidated amended complaint was granted without prejudice. \nPlaintiffs filed a second amended complaint naming only Mexico-based defendants, which was also dismissed without \nprejudice. Plaintiffs appealed to the Second Circuit, and on February 9, 2024, the dismissal of the complaint was reversed. \nPlaintiffs filed a further amended complaint on June 12, 2024. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss on July 29, 2024, and \nplaintiffs filed their opposition on September 13, 2024. On January 15, 2025, the Court denied Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss. The case will now proceed to discovery. \nOther than as noted above, the Group has not disclosed whether it has established provisions or contingent liabilities with \nrespect to the matters referred to above because it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice \nseriously their outcome.  \nU.S. Treasury Securities Investigations. Deutsche Bank has received inquiries from certain regulatory and law enforcement \nauthorities, including requests for information and documents, pertaining to U.S. Treasuries auctions, trading, and related \nmarket activity. Deutsche Bank has cooperated with these investigations.  \nDeutsche Bank Securities Inc., the bank’s primary U.S. broker-dealer subsidiary (DBSI), was a defendant in several putative \nclass actions alleging violations of U.S. antitrust law, the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act and common law related to the \nalleged manipulation of the U.S. Treasury securities market. These cases have been consolidated in the SDNY. In 2017, the \ncourt dismissed DBSI from the class action without prejudice. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss a second amended \ncomplaint, which was granted. On April 28, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. On February 1, 2024, the Second Circuit \nissued a decision affirming the district court’s judgment dismissing the second amended complaint. \nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters \nbecause it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome. \nU.S. Treasury Spoofing Litigation. Five separate putative class actions have been filed in the Northern District of Illinois \nagainst Deutsche Bank AG and DBSI. The cases allege that Deutsche Bank and other unnamed entities participated in a \nscheme from January to December 2013 to spoof the market for Treasuries futures and options contracts and Eurodollar \nfutures and options contracts. Following briefing on a motion to dismiss, the judge ordered supplemental briefing on the \nissues of standing and jurisdictional discovery, which has now been substantially completed. Plaintiffs filed an amended \ncomplaint and then a further, second amended complaint. Deutsche Bank AG and DBSI filed a motion to dismiss on \nSeptember 12, 2023 and a reply on December 13, 2023. On September 30, 2024, the court requested additional briefing \non standing under Article III of the U.S. Constitution, which was completed on October 21, 2024. \nThe Group has not disclosed whether it has established a provision or contingent liability with respect to these matters \nbecause it has concluded that such disclosure can be expected to prejudice seriously their outcome. \n"}

Under these contracts the Group is required to perform under an \nobligation agreement or to make payments to the beneficiary based on third party’s failure to meet its obligations. For \nthese instruments it is not known to the Group in detail if, when and to what extent claims will be made. In the event that \nthe Group has to pay out cash in respect of its fronting commitments, the Group would immediately seek reimbursement \nfrom the other syndicate lenders. The Group considers all the above instruments in monitoring the credit exposure and \nmay require collateral to mitigate inherent credit risk. If credit risk management provides sufficient evidence about an \nexpected loss from a claim, a provision is established and recorded on the balance sheet. \nThe following table shows the Group’s revocable lending commitments, irrevocable lending commitments and lending \nrelated contingent liabilities without considering collateral or provisions. The amounts are the maximum potential \nutilization required by the Group in case all these liabilities entered into must be funded. The table therefore does not show \nthe expected future cash flows required for these liabilities as many of them will expire without being drawn and arising \nclaims will be honored by the customers or can be recovered from proceeds of arranged collateral. \nIrrevocable lending commitments and lending related contingent liabilities \nin € m. \nDec 31, 2024 \nDec 31, 2023 \nIrrevocable lending commitments\n219,767 \n206,084 \nRevocable lending commitments \n49,932 \n49,325 \nContingent liabilities \n73,468 \n65,131 \nTotal \n343,167 \n320,540 \nOther commitments and other contingent liabilities \nThe Group’s other irrevocable commitments and other contingent liabilities without considering collateral or provisions \nwere € 77.0 million as of December 31, 2024, and € 74.2 million as of December 31, 2023.

The amounts therefore \ndo not contain the expected future cash flows from these liabilities as many of them will expire without being drawn and \narising claims will be honored by the customers or can be recovered from proceeds of arranged collateral. \nGovernment assistance \nIn the course of its business, the Group regularly applies for and receives government support by means of Export Credit \nAgency (“ECA”) guarantees covering transfer and default risks for the financing of exports and investments into Emerging \nMarkets and to a lesser extent, developed markets for Structured Trade & Export Finance and short- and medium-term \nTrade Finance business. Almost all export-oriented states have established such ECAs to support their domestic exporters. \nThe ECAs act in the name and on behalf of the government of their respective country and are either constituted directly \nas governmental departments or organized as private companies vested with the official mandate of the government to \nact on its behalf. Terms and conditions of such ECA guarantees are broadly similar due to the fact that most of the ECAs \nact within the scope of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) consensus rules. The OECD \nconsensus rules, an intergovernmental agreement of the OECD member states, define benchmarks intended to ensure \nthat a fair competition between different exporting nations will take place. \nIn some countries dedicated funding programs with governmental support are offered for ECA-covered financings. The \nGroup makes use of such programs to assist its clients in the financing of exported goods and services. In certain financings, \nthe Group also receives government guarantees from national and international governmental institutions as collateral to \nsupport financings in the interest of the respective governments. The majority of such ECA guarantees received by the \nGroup were issued either by the Euler-Hermes S.A. acting on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany, by the Atradius \nCredito y Caucion S.A. de Seguros y Reaseguros acting on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain or by the Korea Trade Insurance \nCorporation acting on behalf of the Republic of Korea. \n"}

Part of such contributions \nmay be provided in the form of irrevocable payment commitments (IPCs) backed by cash and securities collateral. \nIPCs related to the bank levy according to the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), the SRF and the deposit \nprotection provided by the German deposit protection fund amounted to € 1.5 billion as of December 31, 2024 \n(December 31, 2023: € 1.4 billion). Thereof € 1.0 billion of IPCs related to the SRF (December 31, 2023: € 1.0 billion) and \n€ 0.5 billion to the German deposit protection fund (December 31, 2023: € 0.5 billion). \nAs of December 31, 2024, the total collateral provided for IPC consisted of€ 1.0 billion of cash collateral and € 481 million \nof securities collateral (December 31, 2023: € 1.4 billion and € 81 million, respectively).

Also, the Group \nremains the economic owner of the collateral provided. \nIn October 2023, in a matter unrelated to the Group, the General Court of the EU handed down a judgement which \nsupported the SRB in its view that in case an entity that no longer falls within the scope of the Single Resolution \nMechanism, its IPCs are cancelled and collateral backing these commitments is only returned if the entity pays a cash \ncontribution to the SRF at the same amount. The plaintiff filed an appeal against this judgement to the Court of Justice of \nthe EU in January 2024.

The Group’s plans are accounted for based on the nature and substance of the plan. \nGenerally, for defined benefit plans the value of a participant’s accrued benefit is based on each employee’s remuneration \nand length of service; contributions to defined contribution plans are typically based on a percentage of each employee’s \nremuneration. The rest of this note focuses predominantly on the Group’s defined benefit plans. \nThe Group’s defined benefit plans are primarily described on a geographical basis, reflecting differences in the nature and \nrisks of benefits, as well as in the respective regulatory environments. In particular, the requirements set by local regulators \ncan vary significantly and determine the design and financing of the benefit plans to a certain extent.

The U.S. defined benefit \npension funding ratio excluding Medicare is 95% \nThe majority of the Group’s defined benefit plan obligations relate to Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. \nWithin the other countries, the largest obligation relates to Switzerland. In Germany and some continental European \ncountries, post-employment benefits are usually agreed on a collective basis with respective employee workers councils, \nunions or their equivalent. The Group’s main pension plans are governed by boards of trustees, fiduciaries or their \nequivalent.  \nPost-employment benefits can form an important part of an employee’s total remuneration. The Group’s approach is that \ntheir design shall be attractive to employees in the respective market, but sustainable for the Group to provide over the \nlonger term. At the same time, the Group tries to limit its risks related to provision of such benefits. Consequently, the \nGroup has moved to offer defined contribution plans in many locations over recent years. \nIn the past the Group typically offered pension plans based on final pay prior to retirement. These types of benefits still \nform a significant part of the pension obligations for participants in deferred and payment status. Currently, in Germany \nand the United States, the main defined benefit pension plans for active staff are cash account type plans where the Group \ncredits an annual amount to individual accounts based on an employee’s current compensation. Dependent on the plan \nrules, the accounts increase either at a fixed interest rate or participate in market movements of certain underlying \ninvestments to limit the investment risk for the Group. Sometimes, in particular in Germany, there is a guaranteed benefit \namount within the plan rules, e.g. payment of at least the amounts contributed. Upon retirement, beneficiaries may usually \nopt for a lump sum, a fixed number of annual instalments or for conversion of the accumulated account balance into a life \nannuity. This conversion is often based on market conditions and mortality assumptions at retirement. \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 530, "text": " \n \n498  \nDeutsche Bank  \nAdditional Notes \nAnnual Report 2024 \n33 – Employee Benefits \nThe Group also sponsors retirement and termination indemnity plans in several countries, as well as some post-\nemployment medical plans for a number of current and retired employees, mainly in the United States. The post-\nemployment medical plans typically pay fixed percentages of medical expenses of eligible retirees after a set deductible \nhas been met. In the United States, once a retiree is eligible for Medicare, the Group contributes to a Health Reimbursement \nAccount and the retiree is no longer eligible for the Group’s medical program. The Group’s total defined benefit obligation \nfor post-employment medical plans was € 142 million and € 145 million on December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, \nrespectively. In combination with the benefit structure, these plans represent limited risk for the Group, given the nature \nand size of the post-retirement medical plan liabilities versus the size of the Group’s balance sheet at year end 2024. \nThe following amounts of expected benefit payments from the Group’s defined benefit plans include benefits attributable \nto employees’ past and estimated future service and include both amounts paid from the Group’s external pension trusts \nand paid directly by the Group in respect of unfunded plans. \nin € m. \nGermany \nUK \nU.S. \nOther \nTotal \nActual benefit payments 2024 \n539 \n113 \n85 \n62 \n799 \nBenefits expected to be paid 2025 \n565 \n128 \n89 \n76 \n858 \nBenefits expected to be paid 2026 \n568 \n135 \n92 \n67 \n862 \nBenefits expected to be paid 2027 \n587 \n146 \n91 \n70 \n894 \nBenefits expected to be paid 2028 \n600 \n156 \n96 \n73 \n925 \nBenefits expected to be paid 2029 \n615 \n168 \n95 \n72 \n950 \nBenefits expected to be paid 2030 – 2034 \n3,211 \n911 \n460 \n377 \n4,959 \nWeighted average duration of defined benefit \nobligation (in years) \n11 \n15 \n9 \n9 \n11 \n \n    \nMulti-employer Plans \nIn Germany, the Group is a member of the BVV Versicherungsverein des Bankgewerbes a.G. (BVV) together with other \nfinancial institutions. The BVV offers retirement benefits to eligible employees in Germany as a complement to post-\nemployment benefit promises of the Group. Both employers and employees contribute on a regular basis to the BVV. The \nBVV provides annuities of a fixed amount to individuals on retirement and increases these fixed amounts if surplus assets \narise within the plan. According to legislation in Germany, the employer is ultimately liable for providing the benefits to its \nemployees. An increase in benefits may also arise due to additional obligations to retirees for the effects of inflation. BVV \nis a multi-employer defined benefit plan. However, in line with industry practice, the Group accounts for it as a defined \ncontribution plan since insufficient information is available to identify assets and liabilities relating to the Group’s current \nand former employees, primarily because the BVV does not fully allocate plan assets to beneficiaries nor to member \ncompanies.  \nGovernance and Risk \nThe Group maintains a Pensions Committee to oversee its pension and related risks on a global basis. This Committee \nmeets at least quarterly and reports directly to the Senior Executive Compensation Committee. \nWithin this context, the Group develops and maintains guidelines for governance and risk management, including funding, \nasset allocation and actuarial assumption setting.  \nDuring and after acquisitions or changes in the external environment (e.g., legislation, taxation), topics such as the general \nplan design or potential plan amendments are considered. Any plan changes follow a process requiring approval by Group \nHuman Resources and, above a certain threshold, also of the Pensions Committee.  \nPension risk management is embedded in the Group’s risk management organization, with strong focus on market risks \ngiven importance of capital market developments (e.g., interest rate, credit spread, price inflation) for the value of plan \nassets and liabilities, hence IFRS and regulatory capital. Risk management thereby encompasses regular measurement, \nmonitoring and reporting of risks via specific metrics, as well as a risk control framework, e.g. via the establishment of risk \nlimits or thresholds as applicable. Risk management activities also include the consideration, review and measurement of \nother financial risks, e.g. risks from demographic and other actuarial assumptions (e.g., longevity risk) but also the \nassessment of model, valuation and other non-financial risks. \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 531, "text": " \n \n499  \nDeutsche Bank  \nAdditional Notes \nAnnual Report 2024 \n33 – Employee Benefits \nIn the Group’s key pension countries, the Group’s largest post-employment benefit plan risk exposures relate to potential \nchanges in credit spreads, interest rates, price inflation and longevity, that are partially mitigated through the investment \nstrategy adopted. To the extent that pension plans are funded, the assets held mitigate some of the liability risks, but \nintroduce investment risk. \nOverall, the Group seeks to minimize the impact of pensions on the Group’s financial position from market movements, \nsubject to balancing the trade-offs involved in financing post-employment benefits, regulatory capital and constraints \nfrom local funding or accounting requirements.  \nFunding \nThe Group maintains various external pension trusts to fund the majority of its defined benefit plan obligations. The Group’s \nfunding principle is to maintain funding of the defined benefit obligation by plan assets within a range of 90% to 100% of \nthe obligation, subject to meeting any local statutory requirements. The Group has also determined that certain plans \nshould remain unfunded, although their funding approach is subject to periodic review, e.g. when local regulations or \npractices change. Obligations for the Group’s unfunded plans are accrued on the balance sheet. \nFor many of the externally funded defined benefit plans there are local minimum funding requirements. The Group can \ndecide on any additional plan contributions, with reference to the Group’s funding principle. There are some locations, e.g. \nthe United Kingdom, where the trustees and the Group jointly agree contribution levels. In most countries the Group \nexpects to receive an economic benefit from any plan surpluses of plan assets compared to defined benefit obligations, \ntypically by way of reduced future contributions. Given the relatively high funding level and the investment strategy \nadopted in the Group’s key funded defined benefit plans, any minimum funding requirements that may apply are not \nexpected to place the Group under any material adverse cash strain in the short term. With reference to the Group’s \nfunding principle, the Group considers not re-claiming benefits paid from the Group’s assets as an equivalent to making \ncash contributions into the external pension trusts during the year. \nIn order to limit the extent to which the Group breached the upper end of its target funding ratio within Germany, the \nGroup has claimed around € 520 million and € 490 million from the trust in 2024 and 2023, respectively, from the plan \nassets which represents the benefits paid from the Bank’s assets on behalf of the trust. \nFor post-retirement medical plans, the Group accrues for obligations over the period of employment and pays the benefits \nfrom Group assets when the benefits become due.  \n \n \n"}

The primary focus is to protect the plans’ IFRS funded status in the case of adverse market scenarios. \nInvestment managers manage pension assets in line with investment mandates or guidelines as agreed with the pension \nplans’ trustees and investment committees. \nFor key defined benefit plans for which the Group aims to protect the IFRS funded status, the Group applies a liability \ndriven investment approach. Risks from mismatches between fluctuations in the present value of the defined benefit \nobligations and plan assets due to capital market movements are minimized, subject to balancing relevant trade-offs. This \nis achieved by allocating plan assets closely to the market risk factor exposures of the pension liability to interest rates, \ncredit spreads and inflation. Thereby, plan assets broadly reflect the underlying risk profile and currency of the pension \nobligations.  \nWhere the desired hedging level for market risks cannot be achieved with physical instruments (i.e., corporate and \ngovernment bonds), derivatives are employed. Derivative overlays mainly include interest rate, inflation swaps and credit \ndefault swaps. Other instruments are also used, such as interest rate futures and options. In practice, a completely hedged \napproach is impractical, for instance because of insufficient market depth for ultra-long-term corporate bonds, as well as \nliquidity and cost considerations. Therefore, plan assets contain further return-seeking asset categories such as equity, \nreal estate, high yield bonds or emerging markets bonds to create long-term value and achieve diversification benefits. \nFurthermore, this shift in the investment strategy allows for actively taken market risk exposures from interest rates and \ncredit spreads within defined limits governed by the Pensions Committee. As a result, the market risk from plan assets has \nbeen reduced. \nIn 2024, the Group entered into a buy-in transaction with a third party insurer to de-risk € 1.1 billion of exposure to the UK \ndefined benefit pension schemes funded from existing assets, with no additional employer contribution required. The \nrecognition of the insurance policy as a qualifying plan asset negatively impacted Other Comprehensive Income in the \nGroup’s financial statement by approximately € 120 million. A similar buy-in transaction to de-risk € 515 million of \nexposure occurred in 2023 which negatively impacted Other Comprehensive Income in the Group’s financial statement by \napproximately € 33 million. In total, the Group has entered into five buy-in transactions in the UK with third-party insurers \nprotecting the Group from movements in defined benefit obligations of around € 2.8 billion as at 31 December, 2024.  \n \n \n"}

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 538, "text": " \n \n506  \nDeutsche Bank  \nAdditional Notes \nAnnual Report 2024 \n33 – Employee Benefits \nKey Risk Sensitivities \nThe Group’s defined benefit obligations are sensitive to changes in capital market conditions and actuarial assumptions. \nSensitivities to capital market movements and key assumption changes are presented in the following table. Each market \nrisk factor or assumption is changed in isolation. Sensitivities of the defined benefit obligations are approximated using \ngeometric extrapolation methods based on plan durations for the respective assumption. Duration is a risk measure that \nindicates the broad sensitivity of the obligations to a change in an underlying assumption and provides a reasonable \napproximation for small to moderate changes in those assumptions. \nFor example, the interest rate duration is derived from the change in the defined benefit obligation to a change in the \ninterest rate based on information provided by the local actuaries of the respective plans. The resulting duration is used to \nestimate the remeasurement liability loss or gain from changes in the interest rate. For other assumptions, a similar \napproach is used to derive the respective sensitivity results. \nFor defined benefit pension plans, changes in capital market conditions will impact the plan obligations via actuarial \nassumptions (e.g. via the discount rate and price inflation rate) as well as the plan assets’ fair value. Where the Group \napplies a liability driven investment approach or has insured part of the obligations as in the UK, the Group’s overall risk \nexposure to such changes is reduced. To help readers gain a better understanding of the Group’s risk exposures to key \ncapital market movements, the net impact of the change in the defined benefit obligations and plan assets due to a change \nof the related market risk factor or underlying actuarial assumption is shown. Where changes in actuarial assumptions do \nnot affect plan assets, only the impact on the defined benefit obligations is reported.  \nAsset-related sensitivities are derived for the Group’s major plans by using risk sensitivity factors determined by the Group’s \nMarket Risk Management function. These sensitivities are calculated based on information provided by the plans’ \ninvestment managers and extrapolated linearly to reflect the approximate change of the plan assets’ market value in case \nof a change in the underlying risk factor. \nThe sensitivities illustrate plausible variations over time in capital market movements and key actuarial assumptions. The \nGroup is not in a position to provide a view on the likelihood of these capital market or assumption changes. While these \nsensitivities illustrate the overall impact on the funded status of the changes shown, the significance of the impact and \nthe range of reasonable possible alternative assumptions may differ between the different plans that comprise the \naggregated results. Even though plan assets and plan obligations are sensitive to similar risk factors, actual changes in plan \nassets and obligations may not fully offset each other due to imperfect correlations between market risk factors and \nactuarial assumptions.

In \nthe normal course of business, the Group enters into a variety of derivative transactions for sales, market-making and risk \nmanagement purposes. The Group’s objectives in using derivative instruments are to meet customers’ risk management \nneeds and to manage the Group’s exposure to risks.  \nIn accordance with the Group’s accounting policy relating to derivatives and hedge accounting as described in Note 1 \n“Material Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates”, all derivatives are carried at fair value in the balance \nsheet regardless of whether they are held for trading or non-trading purposes. \nDerivatives held for sales and market-making purposes \nSales and market-making \nThe majority of the Group’s derivatives transactions relate to sales and market-making activities. Sales activities include \nthe structuring and marketing of derivative products to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce \ncurrent or expected risks. Market-making involves quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants, enabling \nrevenue to be generated based on spreads and volume.  \nRisk management \nThe Group uses derivatives in order to reduce its exposure to market risks as part of its asset and liability management. This \nis achieved by entering into derivatives that hedge specific portfolios of fixed rate financial instruments and forecast \ntransactions as well as strategic hedging against overall balance sheet exposures. The Group actively manages interest \nrate risk through, among other things, the use of derivative contracts. Utilization of derivative financial instruments is \nmodified from time to time within prescribed limits in response to changing market conditions, as well as to changes in the \ncharacteristics and mix of the related assets and liabilities. \nDerivatives qualifying for hedge accounting \nThe Group applies hedge accounting if derivatives meet the specific criteria described in Note 1 “Material Accounting \nPolicies and Critical Accounting Estimates”. \nIn fair value hedge relationship, the Group uses primarily interest rate swaps and options, in order to protect itself against \nmovements in the fair value of fixed-rate financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates. In a cash flow \nhedge relationship, the Group uses interest rate swaps in order to protect itself against exposure to variability in interest \nrates. The Group enters into foreign exchange forwards and swaps for hedges of translation adjustments resulting from \ntranslating the financial statements of net investments in foreign operations into the reporting currency of the parent at \nperiod end spot rates. \nInterest rate risk \nThe Group uses interest rate swaps and options to manage its exposure to interest rate risk by modifying the re-pricing \ncharacteristics of existing and/or forecasted assets and liabilities, including funding and investment activities. The interest \nrate swaps and options are designated in either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. For fair value hedges, the Group \nuses interest rate swaps and options contracts to manage the fair value movements of fixed rate financial instruments due \nto changes in benchmark interest. For cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to cash flow \nvariability of our variable rate instruments as a result of changes in benchmark interest rates. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 545, "text": " \n \n513  \nDeutsche Bank  \nAdditional Notes \nAnnual Report 2024 \n35 – Derivatives \nThe Group manages its interest rate risk exposure on a portfolio basis with frequent changes in the portfolio due to the \norigination of new loans and bonds, repayments of existing loans and bonds, issuance of new funding liabilities and \nrepayment of existing funding liabilities. Accordingly, a dynamic hedging accounting approach is adopted for the portfolio, \nin which individual hedge relationships are designated and de-designated on a more frequent basis (e.g. on a monthly \nbasis).  \nThe Group assesses and measures hedge effectiveness of a hedging relationship based on the change in the fair value or \ncash flows of the derivative hedging instrument relative to the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item \nattributable to the hedged risk. Potential sources of ineffectiveness can be attributed to differences between hedging \ninstruments and hedged items: \n– Mismatches in the terms of hedged items and hedging instruments, for example the frequency and timing of when \ninterest rates are reset, frequency of payment and callable features. \n– Difference in the discounting rate applied to the hedged item and the hedging instrument, taking into consideration \ndifferences in the reset frequency of the hedged item and hedging instrument. \n– Derivatives used as hedging instrument with a non-zero fair value at inception date of the hedging relationship, resulting \nin mismatch in terms with the hedged item. This is particularly pertinent in periods proceeding high interest rate moves. \nThe Group’s portfolio fair value hedging relationships include hedges of well-collateralized German fixed rate mortgages \nportfolios where the Group maintains headroom to avoid any hedge ineffectiveness that may arise from an increase in the \ndefault risk of the underlying mortgage portfolio. This also applies to the Group’s portfolio fair value hedge relationships \nthat include non-maturing deposits that the Group’s customers may withdraw on demand. The stable nature of the Group’s \ndeposit volume (refer to Note 26) as well as a headroom means that Group has not observed any hedge ineffectiveness \nfrom the hedge accounting application. In the current year, the Group partly discontinued its macro cash flow program \nthat includes a portfolio of corporate variable yielding loans as hedged item. This discontinuation was triggered by a \nrebalancing of the Group’s hedge accounting designations and the Group has not recorded any hedge ineffectiveness due \nto an increase in counterparty defaults or unexpected pre-payments in the corporate loan portfolio. \nForeign exchange risk \nThe Group manages its foreign currency risk (including U.S. dollar and British pound) from investments in foreign operation \nthrough net investment hedges using rolling foreign exchange forward strategy. In addition, the Group applies cash flow \nhedge accounting for specific foreign denominated highly probable cash flows using foreign exchange forward \ninstruments as hedging instruments.  \nAs the investments in foreign operations are only hedged to the extent of the notional amount of the hedging derivative \ninstrument the Group generally does not expect to incur significant ineffectiveness on hedges of net investments in foreign \noperations. Potential sources of ineffectiveness are limited to situations where derivatives with a non-zero fair value at \ninception date of the hedging relationship are used as hedging instrument, or where the spot foreign currency risk has \nbeen designated as hedged risk, resulting in mismatch in terms with the hedged item. Similarly, for cash flow hedge \naccounting applications the foreign exchange forward instruments generally match the terms of the underlying highly \nprobable transactions such that the Group does not expect to incur significant ineffectiveness in such hedge relationships. \nIn addition to net investment hedges, the Group also applies cash flow hedge accounting (FX CFH) for USD denominated \nTreasury bonds (HTC classified) held in EUR functional entities, utilizing foreign exchange forward contracts as hedging \ninstruments. \nThe hedged risk is the cash flow variability of highly probable HTC coupons driven by movements in spot FX. The Group \ndoes not expect to incur ineffectiveness, as the notional amount of the hedging instrument should be equivalent to the \ncash flow exposure on HTC bonds. The hedge is re-balanced monthly to reflect cash flow decay on HTC bonds, and FX \nforward point risk is not a component of the designated risk therefore a highly effective hedge is observed. \n \n \n"}

As a result, changes of the hedged \nitem’s value used for hedge effectiveness are not fully recorded in equity if it exceeds the hedging instrument’s fair value \nchanges used for hedge effectiveness. Consequently, hedge ineffectiveness recorded within P&L does not always \nreconcile to the difference between the changes of the hedged item’s value used for hedge effectiveness and the hedging \ninstrument’s fair value changes used for hedge effectiveness. \nDuring the current period, increases in the designated benchmark interest rates resulted in negative fair value changes on \nthe associated hedging instruments, mainly related to cash flow hedge relationship on USD denominated financial asset. \nIn addition, the carrying value of these hedging derivatives changed into a net financial liability which therefore aligns to \nthe fair value change shown in the table above.  \nIn the FX CFH, ineffectiveness is not expected considering FX forward point risk is not a component of the designated risk. \nThe change in both the hypothetical and hedging instrument fair value used for effectiveness testing is driven by FX spot \nrisk only, and is expected to offset (subject to a positive capacity test result). \nAs of December 31, 2024 the longest term cash flow hedge matures in 2036. \nAs of December 31, 2024 the longest FX CFH matures in 2032. \nThe financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recognized as Loans at amortized cost in the Group’s \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. \nFinancial instruments designated in the FX CFH are recognized as Debt Securities HTC at amortized cost in the Groups \nConsolidated Balance Sheet. \nNet investment hedge accounting \nDerivatives held as net investment hedges  \nDec 31, 2024 \n2024 \nDec 31, 2023 \n2023 \nin € m. \nAssets \nLiabilities \nNominal \namount \nFair Value \nchanges used \nfor hedge \neffectiveness \nAssets \nLiabilities \nNominal \namount \nFair Value \nchanges used \nfor hedge \neffectiveness \nDerivatives held as \nnet investment \nhedges \n189 \n1,595 \n45,517 \n(2,442) \n736 \n157 \n42,751 \n317 \n \n    \n2024 \n2023 \nin € m. \nFair value \nchanges \nrecognized in \nEquity1 \nHedge \nineffectiveness \nFair value \nchanges \nrecognized in \nEquity1 \nHedge \nineffectiveness \nResult of net investment hedges \n(2,384) \n(81) \n(169) \n(138) \n \n1 Reported in equity refers to accumulated other comprehensive income as presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \nProfile of derivatives held as net investment hedges  \nin € m. \nWithin 1 year \n1–3 years \n3–5 years \nOver 5 years \nAs of December 31, 2024 \nNominal amount Foreign exchange forwards \n36,976 \n318 \n3 \n0 \nNominal amount Foreign exchange swaps \n7,990 \n230 \n0 \n0 \nTotal \n44,966 \n548 \n3 \n0 \nAs of December 31, 2023 \nNominal amount Foreign exchange forwards \n33,347 \n85 \n18 \n0 \nNominal amount Foreign exchange swaps \n8,683 \n579 \n39 \n0 \nTotal \n42,030 \n664 \n57 \n0 \n \n    \nThe Group uses a foreign exchange forward strategy.

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 551, "text": "519 \nDeutsche Bank  \nAdditional Notes \nAnnual Report 2024 \n38 – Structured entities \n38 – Structured entities \nNature, purpose and extent of the Group’s interests in structured entities \nThe Group engages in various business activities with structured entities which are designed to achieve a specific business \npurpose. A structured entity is one that has been set up so that any voting rights or similar rights are not the dominant \nfactor in deciding who controls the entity. An example is when voting rights relate only to administrative tasks and the \nrelevant activities are directed by contractual arrangements. \nA structured entity often has some or all of the following features or attributes: \n– Restricted activities \n– A narrow and well-defined objective \n– Insufficient equity to permit the structured entity to finance its activities without subordinated financial support\n– Financing in the form of multiple contractually linked instruments to investors that create concentrations of credit or\nother risks (tranches)\nThe principal uses of structured entities are to provide clients with access to specific portfolios of assets and to provide \nmarket liquidity for clients through securitizing financial assets. Structured entities may be established as corporations, \ntrusts or partnerships. Structured entities generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt and equity securities \nthat are collateralized by and/or indexed to the assets held by the structured entities. The debt and equity securities issued \nby structured entities may include tranches with varying levels of subordination. \nStructured entities are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the Group and the structured entities \nindicate that the structured entities are controlled by the Group, as discussed in Note 1 “Material Accounting Policies and \nCritical Accounting Estimates”.  \nConsolidated structured entities \nThe Group has contractual arrangements which may require it to provide financial support to the following types of \nconsolidated structured entities. \nSecuritization vehicles  \nThe Group uses securitization vehicles for funding purchase of diversified pool of assets. The Group provides financial \nsupport to these entities in the form of liquidity facility. As of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were no \noutstanding loan commitments to these entities. \nFunds  \nThe Group may provide funding and liquidity facility or guarantees to funds consolidated by the Group. As of December 31, \n2024, and December 31, 2023, the notional value of the liquidity facilities and guarantees provided by the Group to such \nfunds was € 1.5 billion and € 1.1 billion, respectively. \nDeutsche Bank did not provide non-contractual support during the year to consolidated structured entities. \nUnconsolidated structured entities \nThese are entities which are not consolidated because the Group does not control them through voting rights, contract, \nfunding agreements, or other means. The extent of the Group’s interests to unconsolidated structured entities will vary \ndepending on the type of structured entities. \nBelow is a description of the Group’s involvements in unconsolidated structured entities by type. \nRepackaging and investment entities \nRepackaging and investment entities are established to meet clients’ investment needs through the combination of \nsecurities and derivatives. These entities are not consolidated by the Group because the Group does not have power to \ninfluence the returns obtained from the entities. These entities are usually set up to provide a certain investment return \npre-agreed with the investor, and the Group is not able to change the investment strategy or return during the life of the \ntransaction. \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 552, "text": " \n \n520  \nDeutsche Bank  \nAdditional Notes \nAnnual Report 2024 \n38 – Structured entities \nThird party funding entities \nThe Group provides funding to structured entities that hold a variety of assets. These entities may take the form of funding \nentities, trusts and private investment companies. The funding is collateralized by the asset in the structured entities. The \nGroup’s involvement involves predominantly both lending and loan commitments. \nThe vehicles used in these transactions are controlled by the borrowers where the borrowers have the ability to decide \nwhether to post additional margin or collateral in respect of the financing. In such cases, where borrowers can decide to \ncontinue or terminate the financing, the borrowers will consolidate the vehicle. \nSecuritization Vehicles \nThe Group establishes securitization vehicles which purchase diversified pools of assets, including fixed income securities, \ncorporate loans, and asset-backed securities (predominantly commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities and \ncredit card receivables). The vehicles fund these purchases by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities, the \nrepayment of which is linked to the performance of the assets in the vehicles.  \nThe Group may transfer assets to these securitization vehicles and provides financial support to these entities in the form \nof liquidity facilities. The Group also invests and provides liquidity facilities to third party sponsored securitization vehicles. \nThe securitization vehicles that are not consolidated into the Group are those where the Group does not hold the power \nor ability to unilaterally remove the servicer or special servicer who has been delegated power over the activities of the \nentity. \nFunds \nThe Group establishes structured entities to accommodate client requirements to hold investments in specific assets. The \nGroup also invests in funds that are sponsored by third parties or the bank may act as fund manager, custodian or some \nother capacity and provide funding and liquidity facilities to both bank sponsored and third party funds. The funding \nprovided is collateralized by the underlying assets held by the fund. \nThe Group does not consolidate funds when Deutsche Bank is deemed agent or when another third party investor has the \nability to direct the activities of the fund. \nOther \nThese are Deutsche Bank sponsored or third party structured entities that do not fall into any criteria above. These entities \nare not consolidated by the Group when the bank does not hold power over the decision making of these entities. \nIncome derived from involvement with structured entities \nThe Group earns management fees and, occasionally, performance-based fees for its investment management service in \nrelation to funds. Interest income is recognized on the funding provided to structured entities. Any trading revenue as a \nresult of derivatives with structured entities and from the movements in the value of notes held in these entities is \nrecognized in ‘Net gains/losses on financial assets/liabilities held at fair value through profit and loss. \nInterests in unconsolidated structured entities \nThe Group’s interests in unconsolidated structured entities refer to contractual and non-contractual involvement that \nexposes the bank to variability of returns from the performance of the structured entities. Examples of interests in \nunconsolidated structured entities include debt or equity investments, liquidity facilities, guarantees and certain derivative \ninstruments in which the Group is absorbing variability of returns from the structured entities. \nInterests in unconsolidated structured entities exclude instruments which introduce variability of returns into the \nstructured entities. For example, when the bank purchases credit protection from an unconsolidated structured entity \nwhose purpose and design is to pass through credit risk to investors, the bank is providing the variability of returns to the \nentity rather than absorbing variability. The purchased credit protection is therefore not considered as an interest for the \npurpose of the table below. \nMaximum exposure to unconsolidated structured entities \nThe maximum exposure to loss is determined by considering the nature of the interest in the unconsolidated structured \nentity. The maximum exposure for loans and trading instruments is reflected by their carrying amounts in the consolidated \nbalance sheet. The maximum exposure for derivatives and off-balance sheet commitments such as guarantees, liquidity \nfacilities and loan commitments under IFRS 12, as interpreted by Deutsche Bank, is reflected by the notional amounts. \nSuch amounts or its development do not reflect the economic risks faced by the Group because it does not take into \naccount the effects of collateral or hedges, nor the probability of such losses being incurred. At December 31, 2024, the \nnotional related to the positive and negative replacement values of derivatives and off balance sheet commitments were \n€ 220 billion, € 746 billion and € 29 billion respectively. At December 31, 2023, the notional related to the positive and \nnegative replacement values of derivatives and off balance sheet commitments were € 117 billion, € 315 billion and \n€ 26 billion, respectively. \n"}

The CRD has been implemented into German law. The information in this section \nas well as in the section “Development of risk-weighted assets” is based on the regulatory principles of consolidation. \nThis section refers to the capital adequacy of the group of entities consolidated for banking regulatory purposes pursuant \nto the CRR and the German Banking Act (“Kreditwesengesetz” or “KWG”), which does not include insurance companies \nand companies outside the finance sector.  \nThe total own funds pursuant to the effective regulations as of year-end 2024 comprises Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Tier 1 \ncapital is subdivided into Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital. \nCET 1 capital consists primarily of common share capital (net of own holdings) including related share premium accounts, \nretained earnings (including losses for the financial year, if any) and accumulated other comprehensive income, subject to \nprudential filters and regulatory adjustments as well as minority interests qualifying for inclusion in consolidated CET 1 \ncapital. Prudential filters for CET 1 capital, according to Articles 32 to 35 CRR, include securitization gains on sale, cash \nflow hedges and changes in the value of own liabilities, and additional value adjustments. CET 1 capital regulatory \nadjustments for instance includes intangible assets (exceeding their prudential value), adoption of the temporary \ntreatment of unrealized gains and losses measured at fair value through OCI in accordance with Article 468 CRR which \napplies until year-end 2025, deferred tax assets that rely on future profitability, negative amounts resulting from the \ncalculation of expected loss amounts, net defined benefit pension fund assets, reciprocal cross holdings in the capital of \nfinancial sector entities and, significant and non-significant investments in the capital (CET 1, AT1, Tier 2) of financial sector \nentities above certain thresholds. All items which are not deducted (i.e., amounts below the threshold) are subject to risk-\nweighting.  \nAdditional Tier 1 capital consists of AT1 capital instruments and related share premium accounts as well as noncontrolling \ninterests qualifying for inclusion in consolidated AT1 capital. To qualify as AT1 capital under CRR/CRD, instruments must \nhave principal loss absorption through a conversion to common shares or a write-down mechanism allocating losses at a \ntrigger point and must also meet further requirements such as perpetual with no incentive to redeem and institution must \nhave full dividend/coupon discretion at all times. \nTier 2 capital comprises eligible capital instruments, the related share premium accounts and subordinated long-term \ndebt, certain loan loss provisions and noncontrolling interests that qualify for inclusion in consolidated Tier 2 capital. To \nqualify as Tier 2 capital, capital instruments or subordinated debt must have an original maturity of at least five years. \nMoreover, eligible capital instruments may inter alia not contain an incentive to redeem, a right of investors to accelerate \nrepayment, or a credit sensitive dividend feature. \nCapital instruments \nThe Management Board was authorized by the 2023 Annual General Meeting to buy, on or before April 30, 2028, shares of \nup to 10% of the share capital at the time this resolution was taken or, if lower, of the share capital at the respective time \nthe authorization was exercised. As at the 2023 Annual General Meeting, this corresponded to a volume of up to \n204.0 million shares. Thereof, a volume of up to 5% of the total share capital or 102.0 million shares can be purchased by \nusing derivatives, including derivatives with a volume of up to 2% of the total share capital with a maturity exceeding 18 \nmonths. During the period from the 2023 Annual General Meeting until the 2024 Annual General Meeting, 40.3 million \nshares were purchased for equity compensation purposes in the same period or upcoming periods. Thereof, 22.9 million \nshares were purchased by exercising call options. In addition, 16.1 million new call options were purchased for equity \ncompensation purposes in upcoming periods. Furthermore, 71.1 million shares were purchased for cancellation with the \npurpose of distributing capital to shareholders in the same period. Thereof, 45.5 million shares that were acquired as part \nof the share buyback program of € 450 million in 2023 were cancelled at the beginning of the year 2024. The number of \nshares held in Treasury, after delivery of shares for equity compensation and share cancellations, amounted to 31.6 million \nas of the 2024 Annual General Meeting. Thereof, 25.6 million shares relate to shares bought back for cancellation as part \nof the € 675 million share buyback program in 2024.

Treasury implements Deutsche Bank’s capital strategy, which itself is \ndeveloped by the Group Risk Committee and approved by the Management Board. Treasury, directly or through the Group \nAsset and Liability Committee, manages, among other things, issuance and repurchase of shares and capital instruments, \nhedging of capital ratios against foreign exchange swings, setting capacities for key financial resources, the design of \nshareholders’ equity allocation, and regional capital planning. The bank is fully committed to maintaining Deutsche Bank’s \nsound capitalization both from an economic and regulatory perspective considering both book equity based on IFRS \naccounting standards, regulatory and economic capital as well as specific capital requirements from rating agencies. The \nbank continuously monitors and adjusts Deutsche Bank’s overall capital demand and supply to always achieve an \nappropriate balance. \nTreasury manages the issuance and repurchase of capital instruments, namely Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1 \nand Tier 2 capital instruments as well as TLAC/MREL eligible debt instruments. Treasury constantly monitors the market \nfor liability management trades. Such trades represent a countercyclical opportunity to create Common Equity Tier 1 \ncapital by buying back Deutsche Bank’s issuances below par. \nTreasury manages the sensitivity of Deutsche Bank’s CET 1 ratio and capital towards swings in foreign currency exchange \nrates against the euro. For this purpose, Treasury develops and executes suitable hedging strategies within the constraints \nof a Management Board approved Risk Appetite. Capital invested into Deutsche Bank’s foreign subsidiaries and branches \nis either not hedged, partially hedged or fully hedged. Thereby, Treasury aims to balance effects from foreign exchange \nrate movements on capital, capital deduction items and risk weighted assets in foreign currency. In addition, Treasury also \naccounts for associated hedge cost and implications on market risk weighted assets.  \n"}

As a part of Deutsche Bank’s quarterly process, the Group Asset and Liability Committee \napproves divisional resource limits for total capital demand (defined as the sum of RWA and certain RWA equivalents of \nCapital Deduction Items and certain RWA equivalents of Capital Buffer Requirements items) and leverage exposure that \nare based on the strategic plan but adjusted for market conditions and the short-term outlook. Limits are enforced through \na close monitoring process and an excess charging mechanism. \nOverall regulatory capital requirements are principally driven by either Deutsche Bank’s CET 1 ratio (solvency) or leverage \nratio (leverage) requirements, whichever is the more binding constraint. For the internal capital allocation, the combined \ncontribution of each segment to the Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, the Group’s Leverage ratio and the Group’s \nCapital Loss under Stress are weighted to reflect their relative importance and level of constraint to the Group. \nContributions to the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio and the Leverage ratio are measured through RWA and Leverage Ratio \nExposure (LRE). The Group’s Capital Loss under Stress is a measure of the Group’s overall economic risk exposure under a \ndefined stress scenario. Goodwill, other intangible assets, and business-related regulatory capital deduction items \nincluded in total capital demand are directly allocated to the respective segments, supporting the calculation of the \nallocated tangible shareholders equity and the respective rate of return.  \nMost of Deutsche Bank’s subsidiaries and several of Deutsche Bank’s branches are subject to legal and regulatory capital \nrequirements. In developing, implementing, and testing Deutsche Bank’s capital and liquidity position, the bank fully takes \nsuch legal and regulatory requirements into account. Any material capital requests of Deutsche Bank’s branches and \nsubsidiaries across the globe are presented to and approved by the Group Investment Committee prior to execution. \nFurther, Treasury is a member of Deutsche Bank’s Pensions Committee and represented in relevant Investment \nCommittees overseeing the management of the assets of the largest Deutsche Bank pension funds in Germany. These \ninvestment committees set the investment strategy for these funds in line with the bank’s investment objective to protect \nthe capital base and distribution capacity of the bank. \n"}

These matters were \naddressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion \nthereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.  \nBelow, we describe what we consider to be the key audit matters: \n1. \nValuation of level 3 financial instruments and related inputs not quoted in \nactive markets \nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter \nManagement uses valuation techniques to establish the fair value of level 3 financial instruments and related inputs not \nquoted in active markets. The Group held level 3 financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value of \nEUR 26,281 million and EUR 13,382 million respectively as of 31 December 2024. The relevant financial instruments are \nreported within financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, and financial assets at fair value through \nother comprehensive income.  \nFinancial instruments and related inputs that are not quoted in active markets include structured derivatives valued using \ncomplex models; more-complex or illiquid OTC derivatives; distressed debt; highly-structured bonds; illiquid loans, \nincluding those relating to commercial real estate; credit spreads used to determine valuation adjustments; and other \nsignificant inputs which cannot be observed for financial instruments with longer-dated maturities. \nAs the valuation of level 3 financial instruments and related inputs not quoted in active markets is based to a high degree \non management’s assumptions and judgments due to the complex nature of the valuation techniques and models being \nutilized and the unobservability of the significant inputs used, this is a key audit matter. \nAuditor’s response \nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over \nmanagement’s processes to determine fair value of financial instruments and determination of significant unobservable \ninputs therein. This includes controls relating to independent price verification; independent validation of valuation \nmodels, including assessment of model limitations; monitoring of valuation model usage; and calculation of fair value \nadjustments. \nWe evaluated the valuation techniques, models and methodologies, and tested the significant inputs used in those models. \nWe performed an independent revaluation of a sample of derivatives and other financial instruments at fair value that are \nnot quoted in active markets, using independent models and inputs. We also independently assessed the reasonableness \nof a sample of proxy inputs used by comparing to market data sources and evaluated their relevance to the related financial \ninstruments.  \nIn addition, we evaluated the methodology and inputs used by management in determining fair value adjustments against \nthe requirements of IFRS 13 and performed recalculations for a sample of these valuation adjustments using our own \nindependent data and methodology.  \nWe involved internal financial instruments valuation specialists in the procedures related to valuation models, independent \nrevaluation and fair value adjustments.  \nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the valuation of level 3 financial instruments and related inputs \nnot quoted in active markets. \nReference to related disclosures \nInformation on the valuation techniques, models and methodologies used in the measurement of fair value is provided in \nnotes 1 and 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n"}

These scenarios are the basis for deriving multi-year PD curves for different rating and counterparty classes, \nwhich are used in the calculation of expected credit losses. \nGiven the economic uncertainties regarding pronounced movements in interest rates, current geopolitical conflicts and \nother sources of volatility impacting macroeconomic variables, the estimation of forward-looking information requires \nsignificant judgment. To reflect these uncertainties, management must assess whether to make adjustments to its \nstandard process for inclusion of macroeconomic variables into the expected credit loss model and forecasting methods, \neither by adjusting the macroeconomic variables or through the inclusion of management overlays. \nIn view of the significant holdings of non-defaulted financial instruments subject to impairment under IFRS 9 and the \neconomic uncertainty and significant use of judgment, we consider the inclusion of forward-looking information in the \nmodel-based calculation of expected credit losses, and any adjustments thereof, to be a key audit matter. \nAuditor’s response \nWe obtained an understanding of the processes implemented by management, assessed the design of the controls over \nthe selection, determination, monitoring and validation of forward-looking information in respect of the requirements \nunder IFRS 9, and tested their operating effectiveness. \nWe evaluated management’s review of its expected credit loss model and forecasting methods conducted through the \nmodel validation process. Furthermore, we evaluated the methods used to include the selected variables in the baseline \nscenario and the derivation of the multiple scenarios. \nWe assessed the baseline macroeconomic forecasts by comparing them with macroeconomic forecasts published by \nexternal sources. \nWe also evaluated the methodology applied by management to determine whether to adjust its standard process for \ninclusion of macroeconomic variables or to adjust the model results through management overlays. In doing so, we \nassessed the results of management’s sensitivity analysis and compared the macroeconomic variables used to our own \nbenchmark analysis. We also assessed that the adjustments were included in the calculation of expected credit losses \naccording to management’s methodology. \nTo assess the inclusion of forward-looking information in the model-based calculation of expected credit losses, we \ninvolved internal credit risk modelling specialists. \nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the inclusion of forward-looking information in the model-\nbased calculation of expected credit losses. \nReference to related disclosures  \nInformation on the inclusion of forward-looking information into the model-based calculation of expected credit losses \nand their adjustments for stages 1 and 2 is provided in notes 1 and 19 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n \n \n"}

We assessed the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls related \nto credit risk rating, the application of default criteria and transfer to stage 3 in accordance with IFRS 9 and the calculation \nof the expected credit loss. \nWe evaluated the criteria used by management to determine defaulted loans in accordance with IFRS 9. \nFor a sample of commercial real estate loans we analyzed the application of default criteria used for ECL-staging. For loans \nclassified as stage 3 we assessed the significant assumptions concerning the estimated future cash flows from the loan \nexposures by assessing the collateral value, the solvency of the borrower and the publicly available market and industry \nforecasts. We searched for and evaluated information that corroborates or contradicts management’s forecasted \nassumptions. We also tested the arithmetical accuracy of the expected credit loss calculated for defaulted exposures. \nWe involved internal specialists to assess the valuation of commercial real estate collateral on a sample basis. \nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the expected credit losses for defaulted commercial real estate \nloans. \nReference to related disclosures \nInformation on the Group’s commercial real estate loans business is included in Note 19 of the notes to the consolidated \nfinancial statements as well as the section titled “Commercial Real Estate” within chapter “Credit Risk Exposure” (“Focus \nAreas 2024) of the Risk Report (combined management report), which is an integral part of the consolidated financial \nstatements. \n4. \nMeasurement of goodwill for the Asset Management cash-generating unit  \nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter \nAs of 31 December 2024, the Group reported goodwill of EUR 2,963 million that was exclusively allocated to its Asset \nManagement cash-generating unit (CGU). \nFor purposes of the impairment test the recoverable amount of the Asset Management CGU is calculated using the \ndiscounted cash flow model. In this context, significant assumptions are made regarding the earnings projections and the \ninput parameters of the Capital Asset Pricing Model from which the discount rate is derived \nAs the measurement of goodwill for the Asset Management CGU is based on a high degree of judgment due to the earnings \nprojections and discount rate contained in the discounted cash flow model this is a key audit matter. \n \n \n"}

In this regard, we assessed the consistency and reasonableness of the significant assumptions used in the discounted \ncash flow model by comparing them with external market expectations. \nIn analyzing the expected future cash flows of the Asset Management CGU, we compared the earnings projections with \nthe prior fiscal year’s projections and with the actual results achieved and evaluated any significant deviations, also with \ntheir impact for cash flows. Furthermore, we assessed the discount rate by comparing it to a range of externally available \ndata. \nTo assess the above assumptions made in the recoverability the Asset Management CGU we involved internal business \nvaluation specialists. \nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the measurement of the goodwill for the Asset Management \nCGU. \nReference to related disclosures \nInformation on the measurement of goodwill is provided in notes 1 and 23 of the notes to the consolidated financial \nstatements. \n5. \nRecognition and measurement of deferred tax assets  \nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter \nAs of 31 December 2024, the Group reported net deferred tax assets of EUR 7,249 million. \nThe recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets is based on the estimation of the ability to utilize unused tax \nlosses and deductible temporary differences against potential future taxable income. This estimate is based, among others, \non assumptions regarding forecasted operating results based upon the approved business plan. \nIn light of the use of judgment in estimation of future taxable income and the ability to use tax losses, the recognition and \nmeasurement of deferred tax assets is a key audit matter. \nAuditor’s response \nWe obtained an understanding of the process to determine whether deductible temporary differences and unused tax \nlosses are identified in different jurisdictions and measured in accordance with the provisions of tax law and rules for \naccounting for deferred taxes under IAS 12, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the related \ncontrols.  \nWe tested the assumptions used to develop and allocate elements of the approved business plan as a basis for estimating \nthe future taxable income of the relevant group companies and tax groups. \nFurthermore, we evaluated the recognition of deferred tax assets by analyzing the key assumptions made in estimating \nfuture taxable income. We assessed the estimates made in the forecasted operating results by comparing the underlying \nkey assumptions with historical and prospective data available externally. We compared the historical forecasts with the \nactual results. In addition, we assessed the estimated tax adjustments and we performed sensitivity analyses on the \nutilization periods of the respective deferred tax assets. \nTo assess the assumptions used in the recoverability of the deferred taxes, we involved our tax professionals and internal \nbusiness valuation specialists.  \nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the recognition and measurement of the deferred tax assets. \n"}

The estimates for \nrecognition and measurement of provisions or disclosure of contingent liabilities are based upon currently available \ninformation and a variety of assumptions and variables. \nSignificant judgment is required in assessing probability and estimating the amount of an outflow of economic resources \ngiven the inherent uncertainties that exist in civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters. \nDue to the significant subjectivity involved in management’s estimate of the probability and amount of outflow of \neconomic resources for selected civil litigation and regulatory enforcement matters, this is a key audit matter. \nAuditor’s response \nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management’s controls \nover the process for recognizing and measuring provisions and disclosing contingent liabilities for civil litigation and \nregulatory enforcement. \nFor a sample of relevant matters, we evaluated management’s assessment of the probability and amount of economic \noutflow, including the assumptions and variables considered for each respective matter. These procedures included \ninspecting internal and external legal analyses detailing the judgmental aspects subject to legal interpretations. We also \nread minutes of key management committee meetings (including the Management Board) as well as related \ncorrespondence, such as court proceedings, settlement agreements, regulatory inquiries and investigation reports. We \nobtained correspondence directly from external legal counsel to assess the information provided by management and \nperformed inquiries with external counsel as necessary. \nWe involved internal valuation specialists to assess the methodology of relevant matters on which the provision amounts \nwere determined as well as internal legal specialists to assess, for applicable matters, the probability of an outflow and the \namount of provision recognized. \nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the completeness and accuracy of provisions for civil litigation \nand regulatory enforcement. \nReference to related disclosures \nInformation on the measurement of legal provisions is provided in Notes 1 and 27 of the notes to the consolidated financial \nstatements. \n"}

Our procedures also covered the changes during the year on the current IT control \nenvironment.  \nMoreover, we tested the operating effectiveness of prevent and detect IT general controls related to user access \nmanagement and change management across applications, databases and operating systems. Additionally, we tested IT \napplication controls over automated data processing, data feeds and interfaces. Our audit procedures related to IT access \nmanagement included, but were not limited to, user access provisioning and removal, privileged user access, periodic \naccess right recertifications, system security settings and user authentication controls.  \nOur audit procedures related to IT change management included, but were not limited to, evaluating if changes in the \nproduction environment were tested and approved prior to implementation and the ability to deploy changes was \nrestricted to authorized users. \nTo assess the IT Access and Change Management in the Group’s financial reporting process, we involved internal \nprofessionals who have particular expertise in the area of IT audits. \nOur procedures did not lead to any reservations relating to the IT access and change management in the group’s financial \nreporting. \nReference to related disclosures \nFor a general description of internal controls over the financial reporting, we refer to the combined management report in \nsection “Internal Control over Financial Reporting”. \nOther information \nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for the Report of the Supervisory Board.

Since July 2019, \nprogress has been made to fundamentally reshape the bank. In 2024, Deutsche Bank advanced its Global Hausbank \nstrategy, achieving revenue growth, operational as well as capital efficiency. The bank continued to expand its business \nwhile controlling adjusted costs and investing in its platform. It also resolved key legacy litigation matters and put \nexceptional items behind it. \nNet revenues grew to € 30.1 billion in 2024, up from € 28.9 billion, or 4% versus 2023, in line with the bank’s guidance of \naround € 30 billion for 2024. Compound annual revenue growth since 2021 was 5.8% through the end of 2024, compared \nto 6.6% in 2023, in line with the bank’s target range of 5.5% to 6.5%. In 2025, Deutsche Bank expects continued growth \nacross all business areas, driven by net interest and noninterest income. The bank maintains its revenue goal of \napproximately € 32 billion, with potential upside from currency translation effects. \nNoninterest expenses in 2024 were € 23.0 billion, up 6% from the prior year, including € 2.6 billion in nonoperating costs \nfor litigation, restructuring and severance. Adjusted costs declined to € 20.4 billion from € 20.6 billion in 2023. In terms of \noperational efficiency, Deutsche Bank made further progress on its € 2.5 billion operational efficiency program during \n2024. Measures included the optimization of the bank’s platform in Germany, workforce reductions, notably in non-client-\nfacing roles, IT and infrastructure optimization along with a continued automation of front-to-back processes. The bank \nexpects the large majority of these measures to positively impact the adjusted cost run-rate in 2025. However, as \ninvestments continue, the overall adjusted costs in 2025 are expected to remain essentially flat compared to the previous \nyear. The bank anticipates a cost/income ratio of below 65% by the end of 2025, reset from below 62.5%. Nevertheless, \nmaintaining cost discipline remains a top priority.  \nThe capital efficiency program reduced risk-weighted assets by € 24 billion, close to the € 25-30 billion target by 2025. \nThe Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 13.8%, which includes the € 750 million share repurchases authorized for \n2025. The bank plans to maintain progress on capital efficiencies in 2025.  \nDeutsche Bank announced € 2.1 billion in shareholder distributions for 2025, including € 750 million in share buybacks and \n€ 1.3 billion in dividends (€ 0.68 per share), up 50% from € 0.45 per share for 2023. Total shareholder distributions since \n2022 reached € 5.4 billion, exceeding the € 5 billion goal in the bank’s transformation program launched in 2019. The bank \naims to surpass € 8 billion in total distributions for 2021-2025, paid out in the years 2022 to 2026, and to also maintain a \n50% payout ratio beyond 2025. \nCompensation Report 2023 \nThe Compensation Report 2023 for members of the Management Board and Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank as \npublished on March 14, 2024, was submitted to the General Meeting on May 16, 2024, for approval in accordance with \nSection 120a (4) of the German Stock Corporation Act. The General Meeting approved the Compensation Report with a \nmajority of 86.81%. \nChanges on the Management Board and Compensation Decisions in 2024 \nWith effect from July 2024, the Management Board consisted of 10 members. The role of a Chief Compliance and Anti-\nFinancial Crime (AFC) Officer created by the Supervisory Board is expected to further strengthen the bank’s control \nenvironment and place an even greater focus on remediation activities to combat financial crime. With the appointment \nof Laura Padovani to this role on the Management Board, the proportion of women has increased to 20%. \nStarting from 2024 with a simplified Management Board compensation system, the Supervisory Board considers \nManagement Board members’ compensation more individually than in the past, based on an external benchmarking for \nthe respective role and scope of responsibility, with the aim of bringing target compensation amounts into line with \nresponsibilities. This approach consequently reflects its pay-for-performance philosophy.  \n"}
{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 595, "text": " \n \n563  \nDeutsche Bank  \nCompensation of the Management Board \nAnnual Report 2024 \nExecutive Summary \nAll compensation decisions are subject to the boundaries of multiple regulatory requirements. In this regard, Management \nBoard compensation and the pay-out schedules of variable compensation components are limited in several ways. Due to \nthe requirements of Section 25a (5) of the German Banking Act and in accordance with the decision of the General Meeting \nin May 2014, the ratio of fixed to variable compensation is generally limited to 1:2 (cap rule). In order to be in the position \nto offer competitive compensation in banking and to be successful in attracting and retaining the best leaders for the bank, \nthe fixed compensation of Deutsche Bank Management Board members therefore tends to be higher relative to other DAX \ncompanies that are not subject to banking-specific regulation and that have variable compensation that can be a higher \nmultiple of fixed pay. \nThe Supervisory Board reviews the compensation levels of the members of the Management Board annually and regularly \nengages external compensation advisors to support the review and obtain information on market practice, while assuring \nthat these advisors are independent from the Management Board and Deutsche Bank. The Supervisory Board considers \nthe international environment in which Deutsche Bank’s Management Board members need to operate as crucial. \nTherefore, universal and investment banks are seen as the most relevant peer group. Thus, target compensation levels \nneed to be aligned with top performers in this market in order to find suitable candidates. \nWhen making compensation decisions, the Supervisory Board considers stakeholders’ views very carefully. Extraordinary \naspects need to be taken into account in this, such as the need to ensure the retention of existing Management Board \nmembers, the complex profiles with dual or even multiple responsibilities that are seen as necessary for Deutsche Bank’s \ncontinued business success (market access, experience, etc.) as well as the fact that due to regulatory requirements the \nfixed base salary at Deutsche Bank needs to be comparatively higher than at global bank´s since the Bank’s variable \ncompensation has a higher risk profile driven by the long-term horizon, due to a strict link to share price performance and \nmulti-year payout scheme. Also, only few international banks have explicit target compensation structures, therefore \nmarket benchmarks are based on actual compensation levels. These are only comparable to a limited extent. Taking all \nthese aspects into account the Supervisory Board made the following compensation decisions in 2024:  \nA benchmarking study commissioned by the Supervisory Board revealed that the compensation level differentiation \nbetween ordinary Management Board members and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is lower at Deutsche Bank than at \npeers. In order to maintain an appropriate distance from the compensation level of ordinary Management Board members \nas well as employees at the level below the Management Board and taking into account Christian Sewing’s successful \nstewardship during his term of office since 2015, the Supervisory Board decided to increase his total target compensation \nto an overall target compensation of € 9.8 million p.a. This represents an increase of 5.37% (increase of fixed pay by 5.55%) \nwith effect from April 1, 2024. \nThe Supervisory Board also reviewed the compensation of the other members of the Management Board. As a result, the \ncompensation of Claudio de Sanctis was adjusted with effect from January 1, 2024, taking into account his responsibilities \nand thorough insights into relevant market dynamics and client dynamics. Since his appointment he has consequently \nsteered the Private Bank’s transformation to position the business for future success. The Supervisory Board decided on \nan appropriate increase, within an internationally comparable range, to an overall target compensation of € 8.4 million p.a., \nwhich represents an increase of 6.32% (increase of fixed pay by 6.66%).  \nOver the last years, Deutsche Bank has invested substantially in strengthening its control environment and remediation \nactivities. To further improve the resilience of the bank’s controls and to start further alignment of first, second and third \nlines of defense to foster better ownership, processes and efficiency, the Supervisory Board created a new role at the \nManagement Board level.  \nLaura Padovani was appointed to the Management Board as Chief Compliance and Anti-Financial Crime (AFC) Officer with \neffect from July 1, 2024. The overall target compensation for Laura Padovani was determined by the Supervisory Board \nafter conducting a benchmarking with the support of an independent, external compensation advisor. The analysis took \ninto account compensation levels for this specific role at comparable companies (global and European banks as well as \nDAX-40 companies). On the basis of the results of this analysis, Laura Padovani’s compensation was determined in line with \nmarket practices and reflects the Supervisory Board’s approach to set compensation levels more individually, considering \nthe scope of the role and responsibility. A target compensation of € 2.975 million p.a. was considered appropriate, \ncomprising base salary (€ 1.750 million p.a.) and target variable compensation (€ 1.225 million p.a.). The Supervisory Board \nwill review the compensation decision in due course. \n \n"}

The main improvements compared to the \nprevious compensation system are: \n– Lean compensation structure leading to appropriate outcomes and providing transparency. \n– Significant reduction of the number of objectives from up to 70 to approximately 8 Key Performance Indicators.  \n– A three-year forward-looking assessment period for the performance measurement of the Long-Term Incentive (LTI) \ninstead of consideration of past performance.  \n– Strengthening the pay-for-performance alignment of Deutsche Bank’s compensation due to a more ambitious \nachievement curve for one of the Long-Term Incentive (LTI) objectives, the Relative Total Shareholder Return: Deutsche \nBank must outperform 50% of the companies in the peer group to allow for a payout. \n– Reduced complexity of the deferral and holding periods scheme. \n– Increased market alignment and function-related compensation practice as well as harmonization of further \ncontractual agreements of the newly appointed Management Board member’s compensation, e.g., pension plan, \nshareholding guidelines and severance benefits.  \nThe following chart gives an overview of the new compensation system, displaying the Short-Term Incentive (STI) and \nLong-Term Incentive (LTI) metrics with their respective weightings as well as the payout scheme and additional provisions: \n"}

The Compensation Control Committee \nsupports the Supervisory Board in its tasks and prepares proposals for resolutions by the Supervisory Board.  \nOn the basis of the approved compensation system, the Supervisory Board sets the target total compensation for each \nManagement Board member for the respective financial year, while taking into account the scope and complexity of the \nrespective Management Board member’s functional responsibilities, the length of service of the Management Board \nmember on the Management Board as well as the company’s financial situation. In the process, the Supervisory Board also \nconsiders the customary market compensation, also based on both horizontal and vertical comparisons, and sets the upper \nlimit for total compensation (maximum compensation). \nHorizontal appropriateness of Management Board compensation \nThrough the horizontal comparison, the Supervisory Board ensures that the total target compensation is appropriate in \nrelation to the tasks and achievements of the Management Board as well as the company’s situation. The horizontal \nappropriateness is reviewed annually by the Supervisory Board which regularly engages external compensation advisors \nfor this review, while assuring itself that these advisors are independent from the Management Board and Deutsche Bank. \nThe Supervisory Board takes the results of the review into consideration when setting the target compensation for the \nManagement Board members. In this context, the compensation amount level and structure, in particular, are examined at \ncomparable companies (peer groups). Suitable companies in consideration of Deutsche Bank’s market position (in \nparticular with regard to business sector, size and country) are used as the basis for this comparison. The assessment of \nhorizontal appropriateness takes place in comparison with the following three peer groups: \nVertical appropriateness  \nThe Supervisory Board also considers a vertical comparison, which compares the compensation of the Management Board \nand the compensation of the workforce. Within the vertical comparison, the Supervisory Board considers in particular, in \naccordance with the German Corporate Governance Code, the development of compensation over time. This involves a \ncomparison of the Management Board compensation and the compensation of two groups of employees. Taken into \naccount are, on the one hand, the compensation of the senior management, which comprises the first management level \nbelow the Management Board and members of the top executive committees of the divisions as well as the management \nboard members of significant institutions within Deutsche Bank Group and their corresponding first management level \npositions with management responsibility. The Management Board compensation is also compared to, on the other hand, \nthe compensation of all other employees of Deutsche Bank Group worldwide (tariff and non-tariff employees). \n"}

The bank offers its \nclients solutions and provides an active contribution to foster the creation of value. Deutsche Bank is committed to a \ncorporate culture that appropriately aligns risks and returns.  \nIn the interests of the shareholders, the Management Board compensation system is aligned to the business strategy as \nwell as the sustainable and long-term development of Deutsche Bank and provides suitable incentives for a consistent \nachievement of the set targets. Through the composition of total compensation comprising fixed and variable \ncompensation components, through the assessment of performance over short-term and long-term periods and through \nthe consideration of relevant, challenging performance parameters, the implementation of the Group strategy and the \nalignment with the sustainable and long-term performance of the Group are rewarded in a clear and understandable \nmanner. The structure of the targets and objectives therefore comprises a balanced mix of both financial and non-financial \nparameters and indicators. \nIn late January 2025, Deutsche Bank confirmed its strategic goals for the Group in 2025. The organization aims to prove \nitself and lay the foundation for becoming the European Champion. With a clear vision, a strong model as Global Hausbank, \nand a highly skilled team, Deutsche Bank is well-positioned to achieve long-term success. A key factor in this journey is the \nalignment of the Management Boards compensation to the company´s strategic priorities. \nBy aligning Management Board compensation with these strategic priorities, the organization reinforces its \ncommitment to sustainable growth, operational excellence, and long-term stakeholder value.  \nThrough the structuring of the compensation system, the variable compensation of the members of the Management \nBoard is closely aligned with the targets and objectives linked to Deutsche Bank’s strategy and priorities, when working \nindividually and as a team continually towards the long-term positive development of Deutsche Bank without taking on \ndisproportionately high risks. The Supervisory Board thus ensures there is always a strong link between compensation and \nperformance in line with shareholder interests (“pay for performance”). \n \n \n"}

In accordance with the \nrecommendation of the German Corporate Governance Code, the Supervisory Board also determines the ratio of fixed \ncompensation to variable compensation as well as the ratio of short to long-term variable compensation. In this way, the \nSupervisory Board ensures that performance-based compensation, which is linked to achieving long-term targets, exceeds \nthe portion of short-term targets.  \nCompensation caps  \nThe compensation of the Management Board members is limited (capped) in several ways: \n– Cap 1 – the maximum possible achievement levels for the Short-Term Incentive objectives and Long-Term Incentive \nobjectives are limited to 150% of the respective target values \n– Cap 2 – based on the Capital Requirements Directive 4 and as approved by the General Meeting in May 2014, the \nmaximum ratio of fixed to variable compensation is limited to 1:2 \n– Cap 3 – in accordance with Section 87a (1) sentence 2 No. 1 of the Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory Board sets \na maximum limit (maximum compensation) amounting to € 12 million uniformly for all Management Board members. \nThis cap comprises not only the base salary, Short-Term Incentive (STI) and Long-Term Incentive (LTI), but also the \npension service costs for the company pension plan or pension allowances and fringe benefits. \n \nDeferrals and holding periods \nThe Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions generally stipulates a three-year assessment period for the determination of \nthe variable compensation for management board members. The bank complies with this requirement by assessing each \nof the objectives of the Long-Term Incentive (LTI) over a three-year period. In addition, variable compensation is granted \npredominantly as equity-based instruments to achieve an even stronger alignment of the Management Board members’ \ncompensation to the bank’s performance and its share price. After vesting, the equity-based instruments are also subject \nto an additional holding period of one year. Accordingly, the Management Board members are not permitted to fully \ndispose of the equity-based instruments until the respective holding period has ended. During the deferral and holding \nperiods, the value of the equity-based instruments is linked to the performance of Deutsche Bank shares and is therefore \ntied to the sustained performance of the bank.  \nHalf of the Short-Term Incentive (STI) is paid out directly after the one-year assessment period in cash, and the other half \nis granted as equity-based instruments with an additional holding period of one year, after which it is also paid out in cash. \nThe Long-Term Incentive (LTI) is entirely granted in the form of equity-based instruments that are distributed, starting one \nyear after the three-year assessment period, through five equal, consecutive installments, each with an additional holding \nperiod of one year. In total, the full LTI payout amount is available for disposal after nine years, but still subject to clawback \nconditions for an additional period of one year. The chart below illustrates the assessment and deferral periods up to the \nend of the clawback period. \n"}

Restricted compensation for these persons consists of restricted share awards and \nrestricted cash awards. The recipient becomes the beneficial owner of the awards as of the Award Date and the awards \nare held on the recipient’s behalf. These awards are restricted for a period of time (subject to the applicable plan rules and \naward statements, including performance conditions and forfeiture provisions). The restriction period is aligned to the \nholding periods applicable to Deutsche Bank’s usual deferred awards. With regard to the Management Board, these rules \nonly apply to Stefan Simon due to his role as CEO of Deutsche Bank USA Corp. \nIf a member of the Management Board is identified as a “Senior Management Function” (SMF) holder by the Prudential \nRegulation Authority in the UK, specific deferral provisions under UK regulations, in principle, apply. Fabrizio Campelli was \nidentified as a SMF holder for variable compensation purposes due to his oversight responsibility for the UK region. It was \nagreed with the PRA that the proportion of the variable compensation which corresponds to the time spent for this regional \noversight responsibility is subject to the deferral provisions under UK regulation. Therefore, 10% of his variable \ncompensation for 2024 Short-Term Incentive (STI) is deferred in line with the UK regulation, i.e., 4% of the STI is granted in \ncash and 6% is granted in Restricted Equity Awards (REAs) and vests in 5 equal tranches in year 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 following \nthe grant date. After vesting, each tranche is subject to an additional holding period of one year. \nIn its meeting on July 25, 2024, the Supervisory Board decided to grant an amount corresponding to the dividend \ndistributed to shareholders of € 0.45 per share to Management Board members with equity-based deferred compensation \nawards that were in the holding period at the time of the General Meeting 2024. Dividend equivalents are payments that \nmirror dividend payments to shareholders and are often granted under share-based compensation programs. The granted \ndividend awards are calculated based on the dividend paid per Deutsche Bank share multiplied by the number of Deutsche \nBank share units subject to the holding requirement (a fixed EUR value) and subject to the same provisions as the \nunderlying award, including but not limited to suspension, forfeiture or clawback.  \nThe decision to grant a dividend equivalent was made by the Supervisory Board against the backdrop that the deferred \ncompensation components are already to be attributed to the Management Board members economically after the end \nof the five-year deferral period (vesting). The Management Board members are the economic owners of the share-based \ncompensation with effect from the vesting. However, the vested share-based compensation is subject to an additional \nholding period of one year as required by the European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines (EBA Guidelines on Sound \nRemuneration Policies) applicable to financial institutions. The Bank is allowed to transfer shares to the Management Board \nmembers already after the vesting but decided to wait until the end of the additional holding period as they are still subject \nto suspension and forfeiture provisions. As this procedure leads to an economic disadvantage for the Management Board \nmembers, the plan rules for share-based compensation and the service contracts provide the possibility of an equivalent \npayment per share if a dividend is paid on Deutsche Bank shares during their holding period. This practice is in line with all \nregulatory requirements and market practice. Under the EBA Guidelines specified above, these dividend equivalents are \nnot considered to be variable compensation as the value is determined by reference to the shares which are fully vested \nand economically attributable to the Management Board members.

For further information, \nplease refer to chapter “Deferrals and holding periods”. \n4 Member since July 1, 2024 \nLong-Term Incentive (LTI) 2024 to 2026  \nWhen determining the variable compensation, the focus is set on the achievement of long-term objectives linked to the \nbank’s strategy. For the Long-Term Incentive (LTI), the Supervisory Board specifies collective long-term objectives for the \nManagement Board members, each assessed over a period of three years.  \nAt the beginning of 2024, the LTI was initially allocated as a target cash amount to the individual Management Board \nmembers. As the three-year assessment period for the LTI represents a change from a retrospective to a forward-looking \nperiod, the granting of the equity-based compensation takes place two years later compared to the previous compensation \nsystem. In order to align the Management Board compensation with the share performance of the Deutsche Bank share \nand therefore with the shareholders’ interests, the Supervisory Board made use of the possibility that was already provides \nfor in the new compensation system to convert the target euro amount for the LTI into virtual share units after the first \nperformance assessment year (not constituting a grant of compensation at this stage). After the three-year performance \nassessment period, the number of virtual share units will then be increased or reduced according to the achievement level \ndetermined for the LTI.  \nThis approach further strengthens the sustainability aspect of the long-term variable compensation, as it is additionally \nlinked to the performance of the bank and the share price during the assessment period. The conversion was based on the \naverage share price during the last 10 trading days in February 2025 of € 20.011. The number of virtual shares that will be \ngranted by the end of the assessment period will depend on the results of the performance assessment and thus will vary \nbetween 0% and 150% of the number initially allocated. After the vesting and holding periods, 20% of the virtual shares \nwill become available annually but will still be subject to clawback conditions. \n"}

These objectives are key measures for \nassessing the overall financial success and performance of Deutsche Bank and serve as clear performance indicators that \nreflect Deutsche Bank’s business objectives and strategies and are aligned with shareholder interest. Through these \nobjectives an incentive is created to act in a manner that maximizes value for shareholders and supports the long-term \ngrowth and stability of the business. \nGroup financial objectives \n– Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE) measures the profit (or loss) attributable to Deutsche Bank shareholders as a \npercentage of average tangible shareholders’ equity and incentivizes the efficient use of equity. The tangible \nshareholder equity is determined by deducting goodwill and other intangible assets from shareholders’ equity.  \n– The growth in Tangible Book Value Per Share (TBVPS) complements RoTE by considering equity changes apart from \nnet income which are equally relevant for capital distributions. The TBVPS represents the Bank’s total shareholders’ \nequity less goodwill and other intangible assets divided by period-end basic shares outstanding. It measures the growth \n(in %) of the equity of the company per share. \nRelative Total Shareholder Return (RTSR) reflects the shareholder value creation in the form of share price growth and \ndividends generated. Deutsche Bank wants to be an attractive investment for its investors and therefore incentivizes the \noutperformance of relevant financial institutions. In addition, the RTSR objective serves to align the interests of the \nManagement Board and shareholders more closely.  \n \n \n"}

Due to the new compensation \nsystem already described, there was a significant structural change in 2024 in comparison to 2023. The first Long-Term \nIncentive (LTI) Plan based on the new system was set up for the performance period 2024-2026; after the end of the 3-\nyear performance period the Supervisory Board determines the achievement level based on the pre-defined Key \nPerformance Indicators (KPIs). Due to a change from a backward-looking to a forward-looking three-year performance \nperiod, the first two years after the implementation of the new system (2024 and 2025) are years of transitional \n(“transitional phase”). The first Long-Term Incentive -Plan (LTI-Plan 2024-2026) will first be granted in early 2027. During \nthe “transitional phase”, the LTI will be shown with the target amount for calculation and comparison purposes. For better \ncomparability with the previous year's figures, the table below includes a column entitled Pro Forma Total Compensation \nwhich shows the sum of base salary, actual STI and a target value for the LTI. \nThis approach is reflected accordingly in the following below. \n2024 \n2023 \nin €  \nBase \nsalary1 \nActual \nShort-Term \nIncentive \nTarget \nLong-Term \nIncentive2 \nPro-Forma Total \ncompensation \nTotal \ncompensation \nChristian Sewing \n3,750,000 \n2,448,210 \n3,555,000 \n9,753,210 \n8,745,497 \nJames von Moltke \n3,200,000 \n2,005,320 \n3,060,000 \n8,265,320 \n7,605,057 \nFabrizio Campelli \n3,400,000 \n2,347,920 \n3,240,000 \n8,987,920 \n7,996,596 \nClaudio de Sanctis3 \n3,200,000 \n2,057,120 \n3,120,000 \n8,377,120 \n3,712,322 \nBernd Leukert \n2,400,000 \n1,489,120 \n2,460,000 \n6,349,120 \n6,012,121 \nAlexander von zur Mühlen \n2,400,000 \n1,538,320 \n2,460,000 \n6,398,320 \n6,090,841 \nLaura Padovani4  \n875,000 \n236,425 \n367,500 \n1,478,925 \n– \nRebecca Short \n2,400,000 \n1,607,200 \n2,460,000 \n6,467,200 \n6,115,108 \nProfessor Dr. Stefan Simon \n2,400,000 \n997,120 \n2,460,000 \n5,857,120 \n6,080,591 \nOlivier Vigneron \n2,400,000 \n1,277,560 \n2,460,000 \n6,137,560 \n5,952,363 \nTotal \n26,425,000 \n16,004,315 \n25,642,500 \n68,071,815 \n58,310,496 \n \n1 In the column “Base salary”, the target values set by the Supervisory Board are shown in EUR for reasons of comparability.

This involves the compensation components that were either actually paid or delivered to the individual \nManagement Board members within the reporting period (“paid”) or were already legally due during the reporting period \nbut not yet delivered (“owed”). \nAccordingly, except for base salary and fringe benefits, the table illustrates deferral cash compensation (Restricted \nIncentive Awards (RIA)) that resulted from Short-Term Award grants based on the former compensation system as \nimplemented in previous years.

In accordance with \nSection 87a (1) sentence 2 No. 1 of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the limit set for total compensation is \nmaintained unchanged at a maximum of € 12 million uniformly for all members of the Management board as the maximum \ncap based on the financial year. \n2025 objective structure and targets  \nThe compensation system implemented in 2024 works well and produces appropriate results. Therefore, the objective \nstructure will continue to be in line with the compensation system approved by the General Meeting in 2024.  \nShort-Term Incentive (STI) \nGenerally unchanged from 2024, the amount of the Short-Term Incentive (STI) for the 2025 financial year will continue to \nbe 40% of the total target variable compensation and is based on the individual achievement level of short and medium-\nterm individual and divisional objectives.  \nThe specific individual objectives of the Short-Term Incentive (STI) for 2025 will be disclosed retrospectively in the 2025 \nCompensation Report. \nLong-Term Incentive (LTI) \nThe Long-Term Incentive (LTI) will continue to be 60% of the total target variable compensation and consists of collective \nlong-term objectives linked to the Bank´s strategy.  \nFor the three-year performance period 2025 - 2027, the Long-Term Incentive Plan consists of four compensation \ncomponents that are unchanged to the preceding and still running performance period 2024 – 2026 of four compensation \ncomponents. The components “RoTE” (Return on tangible equity), “TBVPS” (growth in Tangible Book Value Per Share) and \n“RTSR” (Relative Total Shareholder Return) remain the same with unchanged weightings. Going forward, the RoTE measure \nis underpinned by the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio to ensure a balanced approach to profitability, capital \nadequacy, and risk management. If the CET1 capital ratio at the end of the performance period is below the CET 1 red \nthreshold level set in the risk appetite statement, then the measure is assessed to be nil. This also applies to the RoTE \nobjectives for the STI.  \nThe “ESG” component will in general also remain unchanged especially with regard to the Environmental and the Social \nobjectives. Deutsche Bank’s policies and procedures are aligned with the laws and regulations in all of the markets in which \nit operates, including anti-discrimination laws such as the 2. German Gender Quota Law (Zweites Führungspositionen-\nGesetz - FüPoG II). \nWith regard to the Governance objective, the assessment criteria were amended in order to reflect not only an internal \nevaluation, but also external stakeholders’ assessment of Deutsche Bank´s regulatory development and improvements, \nmaking it a holistic measurement criterion. Along with the previously considered Control Risk Management Grade (CRMG), \ntwo additional aspects will be taken into consideration:  \nThe European Central Bank (ECB) on a yearly basis conducts a Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) in which \nit evaluates the business models, internal governance, risks to capital and risks to liquidity of all significant institutions \nunder its direct supervision.  The result, together with results from the FED Annual Assessment of the US central bank \nFederal Reserve, is reflected in the overall Regulatory Ratings & Enforcement objective.  \nFurthermore, Enforcement Actions imposed by regulators against a bank when regulatory requirements are not met will \nbe considered. Enforcement Actions can take various forms, e.g. fines, restrictions on business operations, or binding \nmeasures to remedy deficiencies. The closure of still open Enforcement Actions is the third element of the LTI Governance \nobjective.  \n \n"}

The \namount of the annual base compensation for each Supervisory Board member is € 300,000, for the Supervisory Board \nChairman € 950,000, and for each Deputy Chairperson € 475,000. \nChairs of the committees of the Supervisory Board are paid additional fixed annual compensation amounts as follows: \nIf a Supervisory Board member is chair of more than one committee, compensation is only paid for the committee entitled \nto the highest amount. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board does not receive any additional compensation for chairing \nof the committees. Members of the committees also do not receive additional compensation. \nThe compensation determined will be paid to the respective member of the Supervisory Board by, at the latest, two months \nafter submitting invoices and as a rule within the first three months of the following year. In case of a change in Supervisory \nBoard membership during the year, compensation for the financial year will be paid on a pro rata basis, rounded up/down \nto full months. \nThe company reimburses the Supervisory Board members for the cash expenses they incur in the performance of their \noffice, including, to the extent applicable, value added tax (VAT) on their compensation and reimbursements of expenses. \nFurthermore, any employer contributions to social security schemes that may be applicable under foreign law to the \nperformance of their Supervisory Board work is paid for each Supervisory Board member affected. Finally, the Supervisory \nBoard Chairman is reimbursed appropriately for travel expenses incurred in performing representative tasks due to his \nfunction and reimbursed for costs for the security measures required based on his function. \nIn the interest of the company, the members of the Supervisory Board are included in an appropriate amount in any \nfinancial liability insurance policy held by the company. The premiums for this are paid by the company. A deductible does \nnot have to be specified for the members of the Supervisory Board. \nWith the effectiveness of the compensation system for the Supervisory Board on May 17, 2023, the Supervisory Board \nrecommends that its members undertake a voluntary self-commitment to invest a total of at least 10% of the gross annual \ncompensation paid out to them in shares of Deutsche Bank AG and to hold these shares for the duration of their ongoing \nterm of office. The previous provision in the Articles of Association for share-based compensation for the Supervisory \nBoard members was cancelled.  \nThe Supervisory Board is in agreement that any transfer obligations to labor unions will be taken into account in the \npersonal decision on the self-imposed personal investment. Supervisory Board members who already hold, as of the day \nthe voluntary self-commitment is made, a number of Deutsche Bank shares with a countervalue of at least 10% of the \nSupervisory Board compensation payable to them for the duration of their current term of office do not have to acquire \nany further shares. \nCommittee chair \nin €  \nAudit Committee \n150,000 \nRisk Committee \n150,000 \nTechnology, Data and Innovation Committee \n150,000 \nChairman’s Committee \n100,000 \nNomination Committee \n100,000 \nCompensation Control Committee \n100,000 \nRegulatory Oversight Committee \n100,000 \nStrategy and Sustainability Committee \n100,000 \nMediation Committee \n0 \n"}

The \nannual base compensation amounted to € 100,000 for each Supervisory Board member. The Supervisory Board Chairman \nreceived twice that amount and the Deputy Chairpersons one and a half times that amount. \nMembers and chairs of the committees of the Supervisory Board were paid additional fixed annual compensation as \nfollows: \nuntil May 17, 2023 \nCommittee \nin €  \nChair \nMember \nAudit Committee \n200,000 \n100,000 \nRisk Committee \n200,000 \n100,000 \nNomination Committee \n100,000 \n50,000 \nMediation Committee \n0 \n0 \nRegulatory Oversight Committee \n200,000 \n100,000 \nChairman’s Committee \n100,000 \n50,000 \nCompensation Control Committee \n100,000 \n50,000 \nStrategy and Sustainability Committee \n100,000 \n50,000 \nTechnology, Data and Innovation Committee \n200,000 \n100,000 \n \n \n75% of the compensation determined was disbursed to each Supervisory Board member after submitting invoices within \nthe first three months of the following year. The other 25% was converted by the company at the same time into company \nshares based on the average closing price on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Xetra or successor system) during the last ten \ntrading days of the preceding January, calculated to three digits after the decimal point. The share value of this number of \nshares was paid to the respective Supervisory Board member in February of the year following his departure from the \nSupervisory Board or the expiration of his term of office, based on the average closing price on the Frankfurt Stock \nExchange (Xetra or successor system) during the last ten trading days of the preceding January, provided that the member \ndid not leave the Supervisory Board due to important cause which would have justified dismissal (forfeiture regulation). \nIn case of a change in Supervisory Board membership during the year, compensation for the financial year was paid on a \npro rata basis, rounded up/down to full months. For the year of departure, the entire compensation was paid in cash; a \nforfeiture regulation applied to 25% of the compensation for that financial year. \nThe company reimbursed the Supervisory Board members for the cash expenses incurred in the performance of their \noffice, including any value added tax (VAT) on their compensation and reimbursements of expenses. Furthermore, any \nemployer contributions to social security schemes that may be applicable under foreign law to the performance of their \nSupervisory Board work was paid for each Supervisory Board member affected. Finally, the Supervisory Board Chairman \nwas reimbursed appropriately for travel expenses incurred in performing representative tasks due to his function and \nreimbursed for costs for the security measures required based on his function. \nIn the interest of the company, the members of the Supervisory Board were included in an appropriate amount in a financial \nliability insurance policy held by the company. The premiums for this were paid by the company. \n \n"}

In \naccordance with regulatory requirements, equivalent reports for 2024 are prepared for BHW Bausparkasse AG classified \nas Significant Institution in the meaning of the German Banking Act as well as for other subsidiaries within Deutsche Bank \nGroup in accordance with local regulatory requirements. \nRegulatory environment \nEnsuring compliance with regulatory requirements is an overarching consideration in the bank’s Group Compensation \nStrategy. The bank strives to be at the forefront of implementing regulatory requirements with respect to compensation \nand will continue to maintain a close exchange with its prudential supervisor, the European Central Bank (ECB), to be in \ncompliance with all existing and new requirements. \nAs an EU-headquartered institution, Deutsche Bank is subject to the Capital Requirements Regulation/Directive \n(CRR/CRD) globally, as transposed into German national law in the German Banking Act and InstVV. These rules are applied \nto all of Deutsche Bank subsidiaries and branches world-wide to the extent required in accordance with Section 27 InstVV. \nAs a Significant Institution within the meaning of the German Banking Act, Deutsche Bank identifies all employees whose \nwork is deemed to have a material impact on the overall risk profile (Material Risk Takers or MRTs) in accordance with the \ncriteria stipulated in the German Banking Act and in the Commission Delegated Regulation 2021/923. MRT identification \nis performed for Deutsche Bank Group as well as for institutions in the EU at institutional level. \nTaking into account more specific sectorial legislation and in accordance with InstVV, some of Deutsche Bank’s subsidiaries \n(in particular within the DWS Group) fall under sector specific remuneration rules, such as the Alternative Investments \nFund Managers Directive (AIFMD), the Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities Directive (UCITS) \nand the Investment Firm Directive (IFD) including the applicable local transpositions. MRTs are also identified in these \nsubsidiaries. Identified employees are subject to the remuneration provisions outlined in the applicable Guidelines on \nsound remuneration policies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European \nBanking Authority (EBA). \nDeutsche Bank takes into account the regulations targeted at employees who engage directly or indirectly with the bank’s \nclients, for instance as per the local transpositions of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II – MiFID II. \nAccordingly, specific provisions for employees deemed to be Relevant Persons are implemented with a view to ensuring \nthat they act in the best interest of the bank’s clients. \nWhere applicable, Deutsche Bank is also subject to specific rules and regulations implemented by local regulators. Many \nof these requirements are aligned with the InstVV. However, where variations are apparent, proactive and open discussions \nwith regulators have enabled the bank to follow the local regulations whilst ensuring that any impacted employees or \nlocations remain within the bank’s overall Group Compensation Framework. This includes, amongst others, the \ncompensation structures applied to Covered Employees in the United States under the requirements of the Federal \nReserve Board as well as the requirements related to compensation recovery for executive officers in the event of an \naccounting restatement as required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In any case, the InstVV requirements \nare applied as minimum standards globally. \n"}

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 633, "text": " \n \n601  \nDeutsche Bank  \nCompensation of the employees (unaudited) \nAnnual Report 2024 \nGroup Compensation Framework \nGroup Compensation Framework \nThe compensation framework, generally applicable globally across all regions and business lines, emphasizes an \nappropriate balance between Fixed Pay (FP) and Variable Compensation (VC) – together forming Total Compensation (TC). \nIt aligns incentives for sustainable performance at all levels of Deutsche Bank whilst ensuring the transparency of \ncompensation decisions and their impact on shareholders and employees. The underlying principles of Deutsche Bank’s \nCompensation Framework are applied to all employees equally and are supported by the key principle ‘equal pay for equal \nwork or work of equal value’ and the necessity for equal opportunities, irrespective of differences in, e.g., tenure, gender \nor ethnicity. \nPursuant to CRD and the requirements subsequently adopted in the German Banking Act, Deutsche Bank is subject to a \nmaximum ratio of 1:1 with regard to fixed-to-variable remuneration components, which was increased to 1:2 for a limited \npopulation with shareholder approval on May 22, 2014 with an approval rate of 95.27%, based on valid votes by 27.68% of \nthe share capital represented at the Annual General Meeting. Control Functions as defined by InstVV, comprising Risk, \nCompliance and Anti-Financial Crime, Group Audit and the Group Compensation Officer and his Deputy, are subject to a \nmaximum ratio of 2:1. Employees in certain infrastructure functions should continue to be subject to a maximum ratio of \n1:1. \nWith effect from 2024 the bank amended and simplified its compensation framework by ensuring all employees are eligible \nfor individual VC, by incorporating the former Group VC Component into the overall VC pool determination, and by \nremoving both Reference Total Compensation and Recognition Awards. To maintain an appropriate balance between FP \nand VC, the bank implemented a more standardized VC orientation concept with orientation values based on division, \nprofession and seniority that indicate the average expected VC as a percentage value of FP. \nFixed Pay is the key and primary compensation element for most employees globally. It is a fixed regular payment based \non transparent and predetermined conditions. It is delivered either in the form of base salary and where applicable local \nspecific fixed pay allowances. Fixed Pay reflects the value of the individual role and function within the organization, \nregional and divisional specifics and rewards the factors an employee brings to the organization such as qualification, skills \nand experience required for the role in line with remuneration levels in the specific geographic location and level of \nresponsibility. \nVariable Compensation is a discretionary compensation component that reflects Group, Divisional risk-adjusted financial \nand non-financial performance as well as individual contributions. It acknowledges that employees contribute towards the \nsuccess of their Division and the Group as a whole. At the same time, VC allows the bank to differentiate individual \ncontributions and to drive behavior and conduct through an incentive system that can positively influence culture and the \nachievement of the bank’s strategic objectives and to apply consequences for falling below the standards of delivery, \nbehavior and conduct by reducing the VC. \nIn the context of InstVV, severance payments are considered variable compensation. The bank’s severance framework \nensures full alignment with the respective InstVV requirements. \nEmployee benefits are considered FP from a regulatory perspective, as they have no direct link to performance or \ndiscretion. They are granted in accordance with applicable local market practices and requirements. Pension expenses \nrepresent the main element of the bank’s benefits portfolio globally. \nTotal Compensation (TC) is made up of defined Fixed Pay, Variable Compensation and is supplemented by benefits. \n"}

In general, non-\nexecutive and tariff staff in Postbank units receive VC, but the structure and portion of VC can differ between legal entities. \nDWS \nDWS asset management entities and employees fall under AIFMD, UCITS or IFD regulation, with only a very limited number \nof employees remain in scope of the bank’s Group InstVV requirements. DWS has established its own compensation \ngovernance, policy, and structures, as well as Risk Taker identification process in line with its regulatory requirements. \nThese structures and processes are aligned with InstVV where required but tailored towards the Asset Management \nbusiness. Pursuant to the ESMA/EBA Guidelines, DWS’s compensation strategy is designed to ensure an appropriate ratio \nbetween fixed and variable compensation. \nGenerally, DWS applies remuneration rules that are equivalent to the Deutsche Bank Group approach, but use DWS Group-\nrelated parameters, where possible. Notable deviations from the Group Compensation Framework include the use of \nshare-based instruments linked to DWS shares and fund-linked instruments. These serve to improve the alignment of \nemployee compensation with DWS’ shareholders’ and investors’ interests. \nTariff staff \nTariff staff are either subject to a collective agreement (Tarifvertrag für das private Bankgewerbe und die öffentlichen \nBanken), as negotiated between trade unions and employer associations, or subject to agreements as negotiated with the \nrespective trade unions directly. The remuneration of tariff staff is included in the quantitative disclosures in this Report. \n"}

A robust set of rule-\nbased principles for compensation decisions with close links to the performance of both businesses and individuals were \napplied. \nThe total amount of VC for any given performance year is derived from an assessment of the bank’s profitability, solvency, \nand liquidity position (affordability assessment), Group performance and the performance of divisions and infrastructure \nfunctions in support of achieving the bank’s strategic objectives. \nIn a first step, Deutsche Bank assesses the bank’s affordability as well as other limitations (such as cost constraints) to \ndetermine what the bank “can” award in line with regulatory and internal requirements. In the next step, the bank assesses \ndivisional risk-adjusted performance, i.e. what the bank “should” award in order to provide an appropriate compensation \nfor contributions to the bank’s success. The proportion of the VC pools related to Group performance, which has a \nweighting of 25%, is determined based on the performance of a selected number of Group’s Key Performance Indicators \n(KPIs), including Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) Capital Ratio, Cost/Income Ratio (CIR), Post-Tax Return on Tangible Equity \n(RoTE), ESG: Environmental - Sustainable Financing and ESG Investments, Social - Gender Diversity and Governance - \nAudit Control Risk Management Grade. \nWhen assessing divisional performance, a range of considerations are referenced. Performance is assessed in the context \nof financial and – based on Balanced Scorecards – non-financial targets. To ensure that performance is reviewed in its \nentirety and that consideration is also given to criteria that are difficult to evaluate with a solely formulaic approach, the \nSECC additionally conducts a qualitative review. Following the quantitative calculation of the combined performance \nassessed VC pools, the SECC will review a set of pre-defined qualitative criteria related to both financial and non-financial \nperformance and may decide to apply a maximum 10 percentage points up or down overlay on the divisional performance \nassessment. The financial targets for front-office divisions are subject to appropriate risk-adjustment, in particular by \nreferencing the degree of future potential risks to which Deutsche Bank may be exposed, and the amount of capital \nrequired to absorb severe unexpected losses arising from these risks. For the infrastructure functions, the financial \nperformance assessment is mainly based on the achievement of cost targets. While the allocation of VC to infrastructure \nfunctions, and in particular to control functions, depends on both Deutsche Bank’s overall and their own performance, it \nis not dependent on the performance of the division(s) that these functions oversee. \nAt the level of the individual employee, the VC Guiding Principles are established, which detail the factors and metrics that \nmanagers need to take into account when making VC decisions. In doing so, they must fully appreciate the risk-taking \nactivities of individuals to ensure that VC allocations are balanced and risk-taking is not inappropriately incentivized. The \nfactors and metrics to be considered include, but are not limited to, (i) business delivery (“What”), i.e. quantitative and \nqualitative financial, risk-adjusted and non-financial performance metrics, and (ii) behavior (“How”), i.e. culture, conduct \nand control considerations such as qualitative inputs from control functions or disciplinary sanctions. VC setting \nrecommendations help managers to translate individual performance (“What” and “How”) into appropriate pay outcomes. \nGenerally, performance is assessed based on a one-year period. However, for Management Board members of all \nSignificant Institutions, a performance period of three years is taken into account. \n"}

Whilst a portion of VC is paid upfront, these structures require that an appropriate portion is \ndeferred to ensure alignment to the sustainable performance of the Group. For both parts of VC, Deutsche Bank shares \nare used as instruments and as an effective way to align compensation with Deutsche Bank’s sustainable performance and \nthe interests of shareholders. \nThe bank continues to go beyond regulatory requirements with the scope as well as the amount of VC that is deferred and \nthe minimum deferral periods for certain employee groups. The deferral rate and period are determined based on the risk \ncategorization of the employee as well as the business unit. Where applicable, the bank starts to defer parts of variable \ncompensation for MRTs where VC is set at or above € 50,000 or where VC exceeds 1/3 of TC. For non-MRTs, deferrals start \nat higher levels of VC. MRTs are on average subject to deferral rates in excess of the minimum 40% (60% for Senior \nManagement) as required by InstVV. For MRTs in Material Business Units (MBU) the bank applies a deferral rate of at least \n50%. The VC threshold for MRTs requiring at least 60% deferral is set at € 500,000. Moreover, for all employees whose FP \nexceeds the amount of € 500,000, the full amount of the VC is deferred. \nAs detailed in the table below, deferral periods range from three to five years, dependent on employee groups. \nOverview of 2024 award types (excluding DWS Group) \nAward Type \nDescription \nBeneficiaries \nDeferral Period \nRetention \nPeriod \nPortion \nUpfront: \nCash VC \nUpfront cash \nAll eligible \nemployees \nN/A \nN/A \n100% of VC, except \nemployees with \ndeferred awards \nUpfront: \nEquity Upfront Award \n(EUA) \nUpfront equity (linked to \nDeutsche Bank’s share price \nover the retention period) \nMRTs with VC ≥ \n€ 50,000 or where \nVC exceeds 1/3 of \nTC \nNon-MRTs with \ndeferred awards \nwhere 2024 TC >  \n€ 500,000  \nN/A \n12 months \n50% of upfront VC \nDeferred: \nRestricted Incentive \nAward (RIA) \nDeferred cash \nAll employees with \ndeferred VC \nEqual tranche vesting: \nMRTs: 4 years \nSenior Mgmt.1: 5 years \nNon-MRTs: 3 years \nN/A \n50% of deferred VC \nDeferred: \nRestricted Equity \nAward (REA) \nDeferred equity (linked to \nDeutsche Bank’s share price \nover the vesting and retention \nperiod) \nAll employees with \ndeferred VC \nEqual tranche vesting: \nMRTs: 4 years \nSenior Mgmt.1: 5 years \nNon-MRTs: 3 years \n12 months \nfor MRTs \n50% of deferred VC \nN/A – Not applicable \n1 For the purpose of Performance Year 2024 annual awards, Senior Management is defined DB AG MB-1 positions; incumbents of MB-2 positions in IB and CB reporting to \nHead of CB and Co-Heads of IB; further individuals with significant business responsibilities; MB members of Significant Institutions in the meaning of the German \nBanking Act; respective MB-1 positions with managerial responsibility; for the specific deferral rules for the Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG refer to the \nCompensation Report for the Management Board \nEmployees are not allowed to sell, pledge, transfer or assign a deferred award or any rights in respect to the award.

These requirements form the \noverarching framework for determining compensation at Deutsche Bank. In particular, management must ensure that \ncompensation decisions are not detrimental to maintaining the bank’s sound capital base and liquidity reserves. \nIn 2024, Deutsche Bank successfully navigated an environment marked by persistent geopolitical uncertainties and \nmacroeconomic challenges. The bank demonstrated its operating strength by delivering a pre-tax profit of € 5.3 billion \nwhile simultaneously absorbing nonoperating costs of € 2.6 billion consisting primarily of litigation charges relating largely \nto longstanding matters, thereby reducing the risk profile of the bank. The bank’s resilient operating performance reflects \nthe successful execution of its Global Hausbank business model. \nThe bank’s employees delivered sustained business growth, with revenues exceeding € 30 billion, together with volume \ngrowth and market share gains in key business segments, while assets under management rose to record levels. This, \ncombined with operating cost discipline, enabled Deutsche Bank to maintain strong capital levels while \nsimultaneously increasing capital distributions to shareholders, including a 50% rise in the dividend proposed for 2024. \nDeutsche Bank’s 2024 compensation decisions reflect its commitment to recognize appropriately the contributions of its \nemployees and set fair and competitive compensation levels while also maintaining cost discipline, investing further in \nbusiness growth and controls, sustaining capital and balance sheet strength, and enabling continued growth in returns to \nshareholders. The SECC continuously monitored potential VC awards with due consideration to these priorities throughout \nthe year. \nWith due consideration for all these factors, the Management Board determined that the bank is in a position to award \nvariable compensation, including a year-end performance-based VC pool, of € 2.514 billion for 2024 (2023: \n€ 1.996 billion). The increase of Year-end performance-based VC as well as the decrease of Other VC is due to a \ncombination of factors. The replacement of Recognition Awards by individual VC for a significant number of employees of \nlower seniority levels, as part of the new compensation framework, accounts for a portion; the strong performance of the \nInvestment Bank also contributes to the increase of Year-end performance-based VC. \nThe VC for the Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG was determined, as always, by the Supervisory Board in a separate \nprocess, but is included in the tables and charts below.  \nCompensation awards for 2024 – all employees \n2024 \n2023 \nin € m. \n(unless stated otherwise)¹ \nSuper- \nvisory \nBoard² \nMana- \ngement \nBoard3 \nCB3 \nIB3 \nPB3 \nAM3 \nControl \nFunc- \ntions3 \nCorporat\ne \nFunc- \ntions3 \nGroup \nTotal \nGroup \nTotal \nNumber of employees (full-time \nequivalent) \n21 \n10 \n16,032 \n7,998 \n24,879 \n4,575 \n7,052 \n29,208 \n89,753 \n90,130 \nTotal compensation \n8 \n75 \n1,410 \n2,611 \n2,462 \n794 \n865 \n2,838 \n11,056 \n10,324 \nBase salary and allowances \n8 \n27 \n1,031 \n1,320 \n1,876 \n486 \n689 \n2,177 \n7,606 \n7,421 \nPension expenses \n0 \n5 \n71 \n71 \n91 \n37 \n52 \n146 \n474 \n440 \nFixed Pay according to \n§ 2 InstVV \n8 \n33 \n1,102 \n1,391 \n1,968 \n523 \n741 \n2,323 \n8,081 \n7,861 \nYear-end performance-based \nVC4 \n0 \n42 \n261 \n1,181 \n314 \n235 \n92 \n390 \n2,514 \n1,996 \nOther VC4 \n0 \n1 \n1 \n7 \n25 \n17 \n1 \n4 \n55 \n133 \nSeverance payments \n0 \n0 \n47 \n32 \n156 \n19 \n31 \n121 \n405 \n334 \nVariable Pay according to § 2 \nInstVV \n0 \n42 \n308 \n1,219 \n495 \n271 \n124 \n516 \n2,975 \n2,463 \n \n1 The table may contain marginal rounding differences; FTE (full-time equivalent) as of December 31, 2024; shows remuneration awarded to all employees (including 2024 \nleavers) \n2 Supervisory Board represents the Supervisory Board Members of Deutsche Bank AG (they are not considered for the Group Total number of employees); employee \nrepresentatives are considered with their compensation for the Supervisory Board role only (their employee compensation is included in the relevant divisional column); \nthe remuneration for members of the Deutsche Bank AG Supervisory Board is not reflected in the Group Total \n3 Management Board represents the Management Board Members of Deutsche Bank AG; IB = Investment Bank; CB = Corporate Bank; PB = Private Bank; AM = Asset \nManagement (DWS); Control Functions include Chief Risk Office, Group Audit, Compliance and Anti-Financial Crime; Corporate Functions include any Infrastructure \nfunction which is neither captured as a Control Function nor part of any division \n4 Year-end performance-based VC considers the newly introduced LTI Plan for Management Board members of Deutsche Bank AG set up for the performance period \n2024-2026, which during the “transition phase” is shown with the target amount; other VC includes other contractual VC commitments such as sign-on awards, retention \nawards and specific VC elements for tariff staff and civil servants; it also includes fringe benefits awarded to Management Board Members of Deutsche Bank AG which are \nto be classified as variable remuneration; the table does not include new hire replacement awards for lost entitlements from previous employers (buyouts) \n"}

Since then Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft has \ncomplied with the recommendations of the “Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code”\nin the version of the Code dated April 28, 2022, published in the Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger) on June 27, 2022, \nand will continue to will continue with them in the future, with the exception of the following deviation:\nThe deviation concerns the second sentence of recommendation G.10, according to which long-term variable\nremuneration components shall be accessible to a Management Board member only after a period of four years, and \nrelates exclusively to the Management Board compensation for the financial years 2021 to 2023.\nThe compensation system for the Management Board applicable for the period up to December 31, 2023, provided \nthat the long-term component of variable compensation vests over a deferral period of five years. As this involves \nshare-based compensation elements, these are subject to an additional holding period of one year after their vesting. \nWith regard to the structure of the deferral period, the Supervisory Board resolved in February 2022, February 2023 \nand January 2024 that, for the long-term component of variable compensation in each case relating to the \nimmediately preceding financial year, the Management Board members will be able to dispose over a first part of the \nlong-term component after just three years and over the last part after six years. The Supervisory Board thus remained \nwithin the requirements for financial institutions set out in the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions \n(Institutsvergütungsverordnung). We do not consider a further tightening of the bank-specific regulatory requirements \nto be appropriate in the context of the previous compensation system. As in the last two years, we already today \ndeclare a deviation from the recommendation, although the Management Board members will not be able to dispose \nover the first part of the long-term components granted for the 2021, 2022 and 2023 financial years until 2025, 2026 \nand 2027.  \nThe compensation system applicable as of the 2024 financial year – with regard to Management Board compensation \nfor financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2024 – avoids the deviation from the Code specified above. \n2.\nThe German Corporate Governance Code limits the applicability of the Code’s recommendations to the credit\ninstitutions and insurance companies to the extent that the recommendations apply to them only insofar as there are\nno statutory provisions to the contrary. Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft last reported on the statutory regulations \nand the effects for the Declaration of Conformity in its Corporate Governance Statement in the Annual Report 2023.\nFrankfurt am Main, in October 2024 \nThe Management Board \nThe Supervisory Board \nof Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft \nof Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft” \n"}

The Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft established a Nomination \nCommittee in accordance with Section 25d (11) of the German Banking Act (KWG) whose tasks are to support the \nSupervisory Board in the following tasks:  \n– identifying candidates to fill a position on the Management Board and preparing proposals for the election of members \nof the Supervisory Board;  \n– drawing up an objective to promote the representation of the under-represented gender on the Supervisory Board as \nwell as a strategy for achieving this; \n– the regular assessment, to be performed at least once a year, of the structure, size, composition and performance of \nthe Management Board and of the Supervisory Board and making recommendations regarding this to the Supervisory \nBoard; \n– the regular assessment, to be performed at least once a year, of the knowledge, skills and experience of the individual \nmembers of the Management Board and of the Supervisory Board as well as of the respective body collectively; and \n– the review of the Management Board’s principles for selecting and appointing persons to the upper management level \nand the recommendations made to the Management Board in this respect. \nThe Nomination Committee to be established in accordance with the German Banking Act (KWG) therefore has numerous \ntasks that go beyond the preparation of the election proposals for the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory \nBoard. A general exclusion of a supervisory board’s employee representatives from a membership on a committee is only \nadmissible, according to prevailing opinion, if there is a material reason for this. Whereas such a material reason can exist \nfor a committee that solely handles the preparation of the proposals to the General Meeting for the election of shareholder \nrepresentatives, a justification for the exclusion of employee representatives is lacking for a nomination committee with \nthe range of tasks assigned to it by the German Banking Act (KWG). Due to the Nomination Committee’s range of \nmandatory tasks stipulated by the German Banking Act (KWG) and the inadmissibility of discriminating against employee \nrepresentatives in the composition of the committees, the recommendation in Section D.4 of the German Corporate \nGovernance Code is therefore not applicable to Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft. Nonetheless, in order to take this \nrecommendation into account, Section 2 (3) of the Terms of Reference for the Nomination Committee provides that the \nelection proposals to the General Meeting are prepared only by the shareholder representatives on the Nomination \nCommittee.  \nAll information presented in this Corporate Governance Statement according to Sections 289f and 315d of the German \nCommercial Code is as of February 7, 2025. \n"}

Information on the composition of the Supervisory \nBoard is provided in the section “Objectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board, Profile of Requirements, diversity \nconcept and status of implementation”. The Shareholders’ Meeting elects the shareholder representatives on the \nSupervisory Board. The Supervisory Board appoints the members of the Management Board and supervises the \nmanagement. \nDeutsche Bank’s Management Board is responsible for the management of the company in accordance with the law, its \nArticles of Association and the Terms of Reference for the Management Board with the objective of creating sustainable \nvalue in the interests of the company. It considers the interests of shareholders, employees, and other company-related \nstakeholders. The members of the Management Board are collectively responsible for managing the bank’s business \nincluding Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) aspects. The Management Board, as the Group Management Board, \nmanages Deutsche Bank Group in accordance with uniform guidelines; it exercises general control over all Group \ncompanies. \nThe Management Board decides on all matters prescribed by law and the Articles of Association and ensures compliance \nwith the legal requirements and internal guidelines (compliance). It also takes the necessary measures to ensure that \nadequate internal guidelines are developed and implemented. The Management Board's responsibilities include, in \nparticular, the bank’s strategic management and direction, the allocation of resources, financial accounting and reporting, \ncontrol and risk management, the proper functioning of the business organization, the systematic identification and \nassessment of the environmental and social impacts of the company’s operations as well as corporate control. The \nManagement Board decides on the appointments to the senior management level below the Management Board and, in \nparticular, on the appointment of Global Key Function Holders. In appointing people to management functions in the \nGroup, the Management Board takes diversity into account and strives, in particular, to achieve an appropriate \nrepresentation of women (more detailed information can be found in the Sustainability Statement in the chapter “Own \nworkforce” of the Annual Report 2024). The Management Board works closely together with the Supervisory Board in a \ncooperative relationship of trust and for the benefit of the company. The Management Board reports to the Supervisory \nBoard at a minimum within the scope prescribed by law or administrative guidelines, in particular on all issues with \nrelevance for the Group concerning strategy, the intended business policy, planning, business development, risk situation, \nrisk management, staff development, reputation and compliance.  \nA comprehensive presentation of the duties, responsibilities and procedures of our Management Board is specified in its \nTerms of Reference, the current version of which is available on our website (www.db.com/ir/en/documents.htm).  \nSustainability \nThe Management Board exercises oversight of the double materiality assessment process to identify material topics and \nmanage material impacts, risks, and opportunities in accordance with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/2772 \nof July 31, 2023 supplementing Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards to the \nEuropean Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). To ensure adequate oversight of the results of the double materiality \nassessment, Deutsche Bank has implemented a comprehensive sign-off process involving senior managers and established \ngovernance bodies. Initially, Senior Certifying Officers formally signed off on the evaluation results for material topics \nwithin their remit. Subsequently, the bank’s Group Sustainability Committee, which serves as the primary governance and \ndecision-making body for sustainability-related matters, approved the final set of material topics. Finally, the results of the \ndouble materiality assessment were presented to the Management Board for approval (more detailed information can be \nfound in the Sustainability Statement in the chapter “Double materiality assessment” of the Annual Report 2024). \nThe results of the double materiality assessment were also presented to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board \nand are laid out in the Sustainability Statement in the Management Report. \n"}

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 653, "text": "621 \nDeutsche Bank  \nSupervisory Board \nAnnual Report 2024 \nProcedures of the Supervisory Board and its committees \nSupervisory Board \nThe Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank AG consists of 20 members – 10 Supervisory Board members are shareholder \nrepresentatives elected by the General Meeting, and 10 Supervisory Board members are employee representatives elected \nby the delegates of employees in Germany entitled to elect them. All Supervisory Board members have the same obligation \nto act in the interests of the company and perform their Supervisory Board mandate in the interests of Deutsche Bank AG. \nThe internal organization of the Supervisory Board and its committees as well as the requirements for its members are \nsubject not only to the regulations of the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz (KWG)) and the recommendations of \nthe German Corporate Governance Code, but also to specific supervisory requirements. Such requirements are founded \non, among other things, the German Banking Act (KWG), the Remuneration Ordinance for Institutions (Institutsvergütungs-\nverordnung (InstitutsVergV)), the guidelines of the European Banking Authority (EBA) and European Securities and Markets \nAuthority (ESMA) and the administrative practices of the European Central Bank as our prudential supervisory authority. In \nindividual cases, the regulatory requirements may diverge from the recommendations of the German Corporate \nGovernance Code (see Section “Inapplicable Code recommendations due to the precedence of statutory provisions”).  \nThe Supervisory Board appoints and dismisses the members of the Management Board, supervises and advises the \nManagement Board and is directly involved in decisions of fundamental importance to the bank. Supervision and advice \nalso include, in particular, sustainability issues. Pursuant to the requirements of the German Banking Act (KWG), the \nSupervisory Board oversees the Management Board, also with regard to its adherence to the applicable prudential \nsupervisory requirements. The Supervisory Board works together closely with the Management Board in a cooperative \nrelationship of trust and for the benefit of the company. Measures to be performed by the management may not be \ntransferred to the Supervisory Board. \nThe types of business that require the approval of the Supervisory Board to be transacted are specified in Section 13 (1) of \nthe Articles of Association of Deutsche Bank AG. These include the granting of general powers of attorney, the acquisition \nor disposal of real estate (if the object value exceeds € 500 million) as well as the granting of loans, including the acquisition \nof participations in other companies for which approval of a credit institution’s supervisory body is required under the \nGerman Banking Act (KWG) or other participations (if the object value exceeds € 1 billion). Furthermore, the Supervisory \nBoard may specify additional transactions that require its approval. Within statutory limits, the Supervisory Board may also \ndelegate decisions on issuing its approval to a committee, in order to increase efficiency.  \nProcedures of the Supervisory Board and its committees \nThe working procedures of the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank AG are supported by the expertise of its members, as \nwell as an efficient distribution of tasks and coordination.  \nFrom among its members and in accordance with regulatory requirements for banks, the Supervisory Board has established \nnine standing committees: the Chairman’s Committee; Nomination Committee; Audit Committee; Risk Committee; \nCompensation Control Committee; Regulatory Oversight Committee; Strategy and Sustainability Committee; \nTechnology, Data and Innovation Committee; and Mediation Committee. The responsibilities, tasks and procedures of the \nSupervisory Board committees are set out in their respective terms of reference and briefly summarized here: \nChairman’s Committee: The Chairman’s Committee handles, in particular, the preparations for the Supervisory Board \nmeetings, Management Board and Supervisory Board matters, as well as topics relating to corporate governance. It also \nsupports the Supervisory Board in the preparation of decisions by the Supervisory Board on the appointment and dismissal \nof members of the Management Board, including long-term succession planning for the Management Board, while taking \ninto account the recommendations of the Nomination Committee. \nNomination Committee: The Nomination Committee supports the Supervisory Board, in particular, in identifying \ncandidates to fill a position on the Management Board and Supervisory Board and in the assessment to be performed \nregularly of the structure, size, composition and performance of the Management Board and of the Supervisory Board. It \nsupports the promotion of talent development and diversity with a special focus on succession planning for the \nManagement Board and draws up an objective to promote the under-represented gender on the Supervisory Board as well \nas a strategy for achieving this. \n"}

It also supports the Supervisory Board in monitoring the Management \nBoard’s prompt remediation, through suitable measures, of deficiencies identified by internal and external auditors. \nRisk Committee: The Risk Committee advises the Supervisory Board in all matters relating to the current and future overall \nrisk appetite and strategy and supports the Supervisory Board in monitoring the implementation of this strategy by the \nsenior management level. The Risk Committee monitors whether the conditions in the client business are in line with the \ncompany’s business model and risk structure. It reviews whether the incentives set by the compensation system take into \nconsideration the bank’s risk, capital and liquidity structure as well as the likelihood and maturity of earnings, taking into \naccount retention risk. \nCompensation Control Committee: The Compensation Control Committee handles compensation topics. It supports the \nSupervisory Board, in particular, in the appropriate structuring of the compensation systems for the Management Board \nand monitors the appropriate structuring of the compensation systems for employees. It prepares the Supervisory Board’s \nresolutions on the compensation of the Management Board members and reviews the use and effectiveness of measures \navailable in the compensation system for dealing with breaches of legal regulations as well as internal and external rules, \npolicies and procedures.  \nRegulatory Oversight Committee: The Regulatory Oversight Committee supports the Supervisory Board, in particular, in \nmonitoring the Management Board’s measures to ensure the company’s compliance with legal requirements, authorities’ \nregulations and the bank’s own in-house policies and in monitoring litigation cases with the highest risks. It monitors the \nManagement Board’s contacts with the regulatory authorities with a significant relevance for the bank (special audits, \nsubstantial complaints). \nStrategy and Sustainability Committee: The Strategy and Sustainability Committee supports the Supervisory Board in \nfulfilling its monitoring function relating to the bank’s strategy, including the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) \nstrategy and sustainability issues. It advises and monitors the Management Board with regard to the definition of the bank’s \nbusiness strategies aligned to the sustainable development of the bank and the establishment of processes for planning, \nimplementing, assessing and adjusting these strategies. \nTechnology, Data and Innovation Committee: The Technology, Data and Innovation Committee supports the Supervisory \nBoard in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities relating to the bank’s technology, data and innovation environment. It \nadvises and monitors the Management Board with regard to the adequate technical and organizational resources and the \ndefinition of an adequate plan for the bank’s IT systems, IT strategy, information security management, cyber and IT risks, \nas well as the data strategy and governance.  \nMediation Committee: The Mediation Committee submits proposals to the Supervisory Board on the appointment or \ndismissal of members of the Management Board in cases where the Supervisory Board is unable to reach a two-thirds \nmajority decision. The Mediation Committee only meets if necessary. \nAll terms of reference are reviewed and updated by the Supervisory Board on an ad hoc basis (for example, upon changes \nin laws or regulatory requirements), but at least once annually. They are published on the website of Deutsche Bank AG \n(www.db.com/ir/en/documents.htm) in their currently applicable versions. \nThe number of meetings and their execution are specified along with details on the work of the Supervisory Board and its \ncommittees in the Report of the Supervisory Board, which is part of the Annual Report.  \nIn accordance with regulatory requirements, the Supervisory Board produced and adopted position descriptions with \ncandidate profiles for the roles as member of the Supervisory Board and as Chairman of the Supervisory Board and the \nchairpersons of its committees. It also issued – in accordance with regulatory requirements – a Suitability Guideline, which \nsets out the principles for the selection, succession planning and re-appointment/re-election of the members of the \nmanagement bodies as well as the criteria and the procedure for assessing individual and collective suitability. Induction, \ntraining and diversity guidelines are component parts of the Suitability Guideline in accordance with regulatory \nrequirements. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board issued a Profile of Requirements (see Section: Objectives for the \ncomposition of the Supervisory Board, Profile of Requirements, diversity concept and status of implementation/Profile of \nRequirements for the Supervisory Board).

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 655, "text": " \n \n623  \nDeutsche Bank  \nSupervisory Board \nAnnual Report 2024 \nProcedures of the Supervisory Board and its committees \nThe Supervisory Board receives reports from the Management Board within the scope prescribed by law or administrative \nguidelines, in particular on all issues of relevance for the Group concerning strategy, intended business policy, planning, \nbusiness development, risk situation, risk management, staff development, reputation and compliance. Furthermore, \nGroup Audit informs the Audit Committee of any deficiencies identified regularly and – in the case of severe deficiencies \n– without undue delay. In addition, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board is informed of serious findings relating to the \nmembers of the Management Board. The Supervisory Board and Management Board adopted an Information Regime, a \ngeneral engagement (interaction) protocol and another engagement (interaction) protocol specifically for regulatory \ntopics. These regulate not only the reporting to the Supervisory Board, but also, among other things, the Supervisory \nBoard’s enquiries and requests for information from employees of the company as well as the exchange of information in \nconnection with preparations for the meetings and between the meetings. \nThe Supervisory Board meets regularly also without the Management Board. This also applies to its committees. In \naddition, the representatives of the employees and the representatives of the shareholders regularly conduct preliminary \ndiscussions separately.  \nThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the Supervisory Board and has a \nleadership role in this. He can issue internal guidelines and principles concerning the Supervisory Board’s internal \norganization and communications, the coordination of the work within the Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board’s \ninteraction with the Management Board. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board engages in investor discussions on \nSupervisory Board-related topics when necessary and regularly informs the Supervisory Board of the substance of such \ndiscussions. These also cover Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) topics. \nBetween meetings, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and, to the extent expedient, the chairpersons of the \nSupervisory Board committees maintain regular contact with the members of the Management Board, especially with the \nChairman of the Management Board, and deliberate with them, among other things, on issues of Deutsche Bank Group’s \nstrategy, planning, the development of its business, risk situation, risk management, risk controlling, governance, \ncompliance, compensation systems, IT, data and digitalization, sustainability as well as material litigation cases. The \nChairman of the Supervisory Board and – within their respective functional responsibility – the chairpersons of the \nSupervisory Board committees are informed without delay by the Chairman of the Management Board or by the \nrespectively responsible Management Board member about important events of material significance for the assessment \nof the situation, development and management of Deutsche Bank Group. The Chairman of the Audit Committee also \nconducts regular discussions with the auditor outside the meetings. \nFurthermore, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board and some of the chairpersons of the Supervisory Board committees \nengage in discussions with regulators. \nInduction and training events \nFor each newly elected or appointed Supervisory Board member, individualized induction and training sessions are \norganized based on their knowledge and skills, while taking into consideration possible recommendations of the \nNomination Committee, in order to help them get started in the new position. The induction events also serve as an \nintroduction to the bank, its Management Board, selected senior managers, the auditor and Group Audit. Through \ncustomized training sessions, the new member’s individual knowledge is expanded and enriched. The Nomination \nCommittee regularly receives reports on the progress and participation in these training sessions. \nIn addition, regular training sessions are conducted for the entire Supervisory Board on current topics. Details on this are \nprovided in the Report of the Supervisory Board. \nSuccession planning and diversity \nPursuant to the German Banking Act (KWG) the members of the Management Board must be professionally suitable and \nreliable and devote sufficient time to their role. The Supervisory Board assess the qualification of the individuals as well as \nthe qualification of the Management Board as a whole (collective suitability). In this connection diversity of backgrounds \nand mindsets plays an important role as well as gender, nationality and age. The Nomination Committee supports the \nSupervisory Board in identifying suitable internal and external candidates to fill a position on the bank’s Management Board \nwhile taking into account the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. For this, the Committee has developed a \nposition description with a candidate profile and a statement of the related time commitment for a Management Board \nmember as well as questionnaires for the assessment of the knowledge, reliability and time availability. The Nomination \nCommittee and Supervisory Board regularly receive reports from the Management Board on internal candidates for \nsuccession planning (“talent pipeline”) and the process from the perspective of the Management Board. The members of \nthe Supervisory Board have opportunities to meet selected senior managers at the meetings of the Supervisory Board and \n"}

With a view to a sustainable, ideally diverse succession planning while also \ntaking gender diversity into consideration, the Supervisory Board also works together with external service providers.  \nFor the selection of suitable candidates, external and internal, the Nomination Committee takes into account the strategic \nobjectives of the bank, the area of functional responsibility on the Management Board, the qualifications, reliability and \ntime availability of the candidates as well as the balance and diversity of the knowledge, skills and experience of all \nmembers of the Management Board, while also considering diversity principles. The appointment to a Management Board \nposition is always made in the interests of the company. Building on the recommendation of the Nomination Committee, \nthe Chairman’s Committee submits a recommendation for the Supervisory Board’s resolution. Based on this, the \nSupervisory Board decides on the appointment of the Management Board members. The first appointment period is for a \nmaximum of three years. Management Board members can be reappointed for one or several terms of office, which may \nbe for a maximum of five years pursuant to the law, whereby at Deutsche Bank such reappointments should generally also \nbe for a maximum of three years.  \nFor each newly appointed Management Board member, individualized induction and training sessions are organized based \non their knowledge and skills, while taking into consideration possible recommendations of the Nomination Committee. \nThe Nomination Committee regularly receives reports on the progress and participation in these training sessions. \nThe Stock Corporation Act (AktG) requires that a company that is listed on a stock exchange and has three or more \nmembers of the Management Board, such as Deutsche Bank, must have at least one woman and one man as member of \nits Management Board, failing which renders the appointment void. In addition, promoting diversity on the Management \nBoard is very important to the Supervisory Board, and it is actively working on Management Board diversity, e.g., in terms \nof gender, nationality and age, as well as different backgrounds and mindsets. The Supervisory Board takes into account \nthe legally required minimum gender participation on the Management Board pursuant to Section 76 (3a) of the German \nStock Corporation Act (AktG) and strives to sustainably and continually increase the percentage of women on the \nManagement Board. With the appointment of Laura Padovani, an internal candidate, to the Management Board with effect \nfrom July 1, 2024, the Supervisory Board expanded the Management Board to ten members and increased the percentage \nof women to 20%. To further increase the number of suitable internal female candidates, the Supervisory Board set a \ncorresponding objective for the Management Board for the preceding financial year for appointing women to senior \nmanagement positions directly below the Management Board and embedded this objective within the long-term \nperformance metrics of the new compensation system for the Management Board. To reach a full achievement level in \nthis category, the percentage of women represented at the two levels below the Management Board has to be at least \n32.5% by 2026. The Supervisory Board regularly discusses the measures and ongoing progress with the Management \nBoard. \nBased on proposals of the Compensation Control Committee, the Supervisory Board determines the total compensation \nof the individual members of the Management Board and also regularly reviews and resolves on the compensation system \nfor the Management Board. Details on this are provided in the Compensation Report and the Report of the Supervisory \nBoard.  \nSelf-assessment \nThe Nomination Committee and Supervisory Board regularly address the assessment of the Supervisory Board and \nManagement Board as well as their work, which is to be conducted at least annually as prescribed by law pursuant to \nSection 25d of the German Banking Act (KWG). This is also the self-assessment of the Supervisory Board pursuant to the \nrecommendation under Section D.12 of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC).  \nAt its meeting on July 23, 2024, the Nomination Committee addressed the framework and schedule for the assessment. It \nresolved that the assessment of the 2024 reporting period would be performed with external assistance. The Nomination \nCommittee reported regularly to the Supervisory Board on the work-in-progress on the assessment. The external advisor \nengaged for this conducted a workshop for the Supervisory Board, which took place on October 23, 2024. The assessment \nwas performed essentially on the basis of extensive questionnaires regarding the work of the Supervisory Board, of the \nSupervisory Board committees and of the Management Board as well as interviews with the individual members of the \nManagement Board and Supervisory Board. The final discussion and approval of the results of the assessment took place \nat the Supervisory Board meeting in plenum on March 13, 2025, and the results were set out in a written final report. The \nSupervisory Board continues to hold the opinion that the Supervisory Board and Management Board have achieved a high \nstandard and that there are no reservations, in particular, regarding the professional qualifications, personal reliability and \ntime availability of the members of the Management Board and of the Supervisory Board.  \n"}

The suitability of each individual member is \nassessed, determined and continuously monitored both internally by the Nomination Committee and the Supervisory \nBoard and externally by the regulatory authorities. This suitability assessment covers the expertise, reliability and time \navailable of each individual member (individual suitability). In addition, there is an assessment of the entire Supervisory \nBoard’s knowledge, skills and experience that are necessary for the performance of its tasks (collective suitability). Passing \nthe suitability assessment of the European Central Bank (ECB) after the mandate is accepted and the continual suitability \nof the Supervisory Board member during the entire mandate with Deutsche Bank AG are mandatory regulatory \nprerequisites for the performance of the tasks as a member of the Supervisory Board. \nTo increase the effectiveness of the Supervisory Board’s work and the transparency for stakeholders and regulators, the \nSupervisory Board adopted a Profile of Requirements in 2022. It is reviewed annually and updated if necessary. The Profile \nof Requirements sets out the general and expanded files of expertise of the Supervisory Board that are required for the \nmonitoring and advising of the Management Board of Deutsche Bank AG. The Profile of Requirements is regularly taken \ninto account when developing the proposals to the General Meeting for the election of shareholder representatives and \nwhen determining the individual and collective need for the training of the Supervisory Board and its members.  \nProfile of requirements for the Supervisory Board  \nThe Supervisory Board specified general fields of expertise and expanded fields of expertise in its Profile of Requirements. \nGeneral fields of expertise \nIdeally, every member of the Supervisory Board possesses these individual qualifications.  \n– Understanding of commercial business issues  \n– Analytical and strategic mindset  \n– Understanding of the German corporate governance system, and – as a result – an understanding of a Supervisory \nBoard member’s responsibilities \n– Understanding of the business model and the structure of Deutsche Bank AG  \n– Basic understanding of the financial services sector, e.g. (i) knowledge in the areas of banking, financial services, \nfinancial markets, financial industry, including the bank’s home market and the bank’s key markets outside Europe, and \n(ii) knowledge of the relevant clients for the bank, the market’s expectations and the operational environment. \nThe fulfillment of these fields of expertise is reported on in summary in the qualifications matrix in the line “General fields \nof expertise”. \nExpanded fields of expertise \nThese fields of expertise refer to the Supervisory Board in its entirety (collective suitability). The Supervisory Board, as a \nwhole, must have an understanding of the specified fields of expertise that is appropriate for the size and complexity of \nDeutsche Bank AG. They are derived from the bank’s business model and from specific laws and regulations that apply to \nthe bank.

{"doc": "Annual-Report-2024", "page": 663, "text": " \n \n631  \nDeutsche Bank  \nSupervisory Board \nAnnual Report 2024 \nObjectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board, profile of requirements \nThere is a regular maximum age limit of 70. In well-founded, individual cases, a Supervisory Board member may be elected \nor appointed for a period that extends at the latest until the end of the fourth ordinary General Meeting that takes place \nafter he or she has reached the age of 70. This age limit was taken into account in the election proposals to the General \nMeeting and shall also be taken into account for the next Supervisory Board elections or subsequent appointments for \nSupervisory Board positions that become vacant.  \nFor shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board, the length of Supervisory Board membership shall not, as a rule, \nexceed 12 years.  \nThe Supervisory Board respects diversity when proposing its members for appointment. In light of the international \noperations of Deutsche Bank AG, care should be taken that the Supervisory Board has an appropriate number of members \nwith long-term international experience. Currently, the professional careers or private lives of six members of the \nSupervisory Board are centered outside Germany. Furthermore, all of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory \nBoard have many years of international experience from their current or former activities, for example, as management \nboard member or chief executive officer or in a comparable executive function of corporations or organizations with \ninternational operations. The Supervisory Board believes that in these two ways the international activities of the company \nare sufficiently taken into account. The objective is to retain the currently existing international profile.  \nSpecial importance has already been attached to an appropriate consideration of women in the selection process since \nthe Supervisory Board elections in 2008. For the election proposals to the General Meeting, the Supervisory Board takes \ninto account the recommendations of the Nomination Committee and the legal requirements according to which the \nSupervisory Board shall be composed of at least 30% women and at least 30% men. In reviewing potential candidates for \na new election or subsequent appointments to Supervisory Board positions that have become vacant, qualified women are \nincluded in the selection process and appropriately considered in the election proposals. At the end of the financial year, \nfour women and six men were members of the Supervisory Board on the employee representatives’ side and three women \nand seven men on the shareholder representatives’ side. The statutory minimum quota of 30% has thus been fulfilled for \nmany years now.  \nThe average age of the Supervisory Board members was 58.3. The age structure is diverse, ranging from 40 to 69 years of \nage and spanning three generations, according to the general definition of the term.  \nThe length of membership on the Supervisory Board of Deutsche Bank AG ranged from under one year to around 12 years \nat the end of the financial year. The average length of membership on the Supervisory Board as of December 31, 2024, \nwas 4.17 years. \nThe diverse range of the members’ educational and professional backgrounds includes banking, business administration, \neconomics, auditing, law, German studies, political science, electrical engineering, information systems and healthcare. \nThe resumes of the members of the Supervisory Board are published on the website of Deutsche Bank AG \n(www.db.com/ir/en/supervisory-board.htm). \nThe members of the Supervisory Board do not exercise functions on a management body of or perform advisory duties at \nmajor competitors. Material conflicts of interest involving a member of the Supervisory Board that are not merely \ntemporary shall result in the termination of that member’s Supervisory Board mandate. The Supervisory Board has issued \ncorresponding guidelines for the identification, handling, mitigation and documentation of potential conflicts of interest. \nMembers of the Supervisory Board may not, according to Section 25d of the German Banking Act (KWG), and shall not, \naccording to the recommendations under C.4 and C.5 of the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC), hold more than \nthe allowed number of supervisory board mandates or mandates in supervisory bodies of companies which have similar \nrequirements. A Supervisory Board member of Deutsche Bank AG may concurrently be a member of the supervisory body \nof a maximum of five companies (including Deutsche Bank AG). If a Supervisory Board member is also an executive director \nof a company, this Supervisory Board member may concurrently be a member of the supervisory body of a maximum of \nthree companies (including Deutsche Bank AG). The decisive factors for determining if this is the case are the supervisory \nauthority’s regulatory requirements in consideration of the local laws. Compliance with this statutory regulation is \ncontinually monitored by the regulatory authorities. In the event of directorship overboarding, the supervisory authorities \nmay require that Deutsche Bank AG revoke a Supervisory Board member’s appointment and prohibit this Supervisory Board \nmember from performing his or her work. In the preceding financial year, the requirements on the admissible number of \nconcurrently performed supervisory board mandates were met.  \n \n \n"}

In the preceding financial year, there were no former members of the \nManagement Board on the Supervisory Board  \nSome members of the Supervisory Board are, or were last year, in high-ranking positions at other companies that Deutsche \nBank AG has business relations with. Business transactions of Deutsche Bank AG with these companies were conducted \nunder the same conditions as those between unrelated third parties. In the opinion of the Management Board and the \nSupervisory Board, these transactions did not affect the independence of the Supervisory Board members involved.  \nSupervisory Board Committee experts \nAudit Committee Financial experts \nThe Supervisory Board determined that the following members of the Audit Committee are “Audit Committee Financial \nExperts” as such term is defined by the implementation rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued \npursuant to Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002: Dr. Dagmar Valcárcel, Dr. Theodor Weimer, Professor \nDr. Norbert Winkeljohann and Frank Witter. These Audit Committee Financial Experts are “independent” of the bank, as \ndefined in Rule 10A-3 under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  \nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board determined in accordance with Sections 107 (4) and 100 (5) of the Stock Corporation \nAct (AktG) and Section 25d (9) of the German Banking Act (KWG) that Dr. Dagmar Valcárcel, Dr. Theodor Weimer, Professor \nDr. Norbert Winkeljohann and Frank Witter have expert knowledge in financial accounting and the auditing of financial \nstatements. \nDr. Dagmar Valcárcel has expertise in the areas of accounting and auditing through her many years of experience as Chair \nof the Management Board of Andbank Asset Management Luxembourg S.A. and Barclays Vida y Pensiones, S.A.U. and \nthrough her current work as member of the Board of Directors of Antin Infrastructure Partners S.A. Dr. Theodor Weimer \nhas expertise in the areas of accounting and auditing through his many years of experience as Chief Executive Officer of \nHypoVereinsbank/UniCredit AG and as a former member of the Audit Committee of ERGO Gruppe AG as well as through \nhis work as Chairman of the Executive Board of Deutsche Börse AG. Professor Dr. Norbert Winkeljohann has expertise in \nthe areas of accounting and auditing through his education and training as an auditor and his many years of experience as \nan auditor at various auditing firms and as Chairman of the Management Board of PwC Europe SE. Frank Witter has \nexpertise in the areas of accounting and auditing through his many years of experience as Chief Financial Officer of \nVolkswagen AG and as Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen Financial Services AG.  \nCompensation Control Committee Compensation experts \nPursuant to Section 25d (12) of the German Banking Act (KWG), at least one member of the Compensation Control \nCommittee must have sufficient expertise and professional experience in the field of risk management and risk controlling, \nin particular, with regard to the mechanisms to align compensation systems to the company’s overall risk appetite and \nstrategy and the bank’s capital base. Based on the recommendation of the Compensation Control Committee, the \nSupervisory Board resolved to specify by name Dr. Dagmar Valcárcel, Alexander Wynaendts and Professor Dr. Norbert \nWinkeljohann as Compensation Control Committee Compensation Experts. All of them have expertise and professional \nexperience in the field of risk management and risk controlling, in particular with regard to mechanisms to align the \ncompensation systems to the company’s overall risk appetite and strategy and its capital base. They therefore fulfill the \nrequirements of Section 25d (12) of the German Banking Act (KWG). Dr. Valcárcel has comprehensive legal experience \nwith compensation frameworks, including reputational risks, from her time as, among other things, Head of the Legal \nDepartment of Barclays PLC for Western Europe.

In addition, promoting diversity on the Management \nBoard is very important to the Supervisory Board, and it is intensively addressing the topic. It is actively working on \nManagement Board diversity, e.g., in terms of gender, nationality and age, as well as different backgrounds and mindsets.  \nMoreover, the AktG requires that the Management Board of a listed company sets targets for the share of women in the \ntwo management layers below the Management Board. The Supervisory Board and Management Board strive to and \nshould serve as role models for the bank regarding diversity, equity and inclusion generally. In accordance with the bank’s \nvalues and beliefs specified above, diversity in the composition of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board also \nfacilitates the proper performance of the tasks and duties assigned to them by law, the Articles of Association and Terms \nof Reference. \nAs an integral part of Deutsche Bank’s strategy as a leading European bank with a global reach and a strong home market \nin Germany, diversity is a decisive factor for the bank’s success. Diversity, equity and inclusion help Deutsche Bank in \nforming and strengthening relationships with its clients and partners in the societies where the bank does business. \nAge and gender as well as educational and professional backgrounds have long been accepted as key aspects of the far \nmore comprehensive understanding of diversity at Deutsche Bank. \nThe bank is convinced that diversity, equity and inclusion stimulate innovation, for example, and helps the bank to take \nmore balanced decisions and thus play a decisive role for the success of Deutsche Bank. Diversity and inclusion are \ntherefore integral components of the bank’s values and beliefs and its Code of Conduct. \nThe targets for the proportion of women in management positions, the gender quota and the disclosure pursuant to \nSection 96 (2) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) are described in the \"Sustainability Statement\" in the section \n\"Own Workforce\" \nDiversity concept for the Supervisory Board  \nThe diversity concept for the Supervisory Board and its implementation are described in the section “Supervisory Board - \nObjectives for the composition of the Supervisory Board, Profile of Requirements, diversity concept and status of \nimplementation”. \nDiversity concept and succession planning for the Management Board  \nThrough the composition of the Management Board, it is to be ensured that its members have, at all times, the required \nknowledge, skills and experience necessary to properly perform their tasks. Accordingly, when selecting members for the \nManagement Board, care is to be taken that they collectively have sufficient expertise and diversity within the meaning of \nthe objectives specified above. Furthermore, the Supervisory Board and Management Board are to ensure long-term \nsuccession planning. \nThe Act to Supplement and Amend Regulations on the Equal Participation of Women and Men in Management Positions \nin the Private and Public Sectors (Equal Participation Act II (FüPoG II) requires that at least one woman and one man be \nappointed to a management board with more than three members; however, no additional goals must be set. The bank \nfulfilled this requirement as of December 31, 2024, as it has two women on the Management Board. In general, a \nManagement Board member should not be older at the end of his or her appointment period than the regular retirement \nage according to the rules of the statutory pension insurance scheme applicable in Germany for the long-term insured to \nclaim an early retirement pension.  \n \n"}

This profile takes \ninto account an “Expertise and Capabilities Matrix”, specifying, among other things, the required knowledge, skills and \nexperience to perform the tasks as Management Board member, in order to successfully develop and implement the bank’s \nstrategy in the respective market or the respective division and as a management body collectively. The Management \nBoard reviews succession plans for Management Board positions, both individually and as a group. Individual succession \nplans are reviewed and internal succession candidates are discussed in detail based on potential, leadership skills and \nexperience as well as fit and proper suitability. As gender diversity is a key focus of Deutsche Bank, the respective \nsuccession metrics and data analytics support this process. After approval by the Management Board these plans are \nsubmitted to the Nomination Committee and the Supervisory Board in principle at a meeting for extensive deliberation. \nIn identifying candidates to fill a position on the bank’s Management Board, the Supervisory Board’s Nomination \nCommittee takes into account the appropriate diversity balance of all Management Board members collectively. \nFurthermore, it also considers the targets set by the Supervisory Board in accordance with statutory requirements for the \npercentage of women on the Management Board.  \nThe Nomination Committee supports the Supervisory Board with the periodic assessment, to be performed at least once \na year, of the knowledge, skills and experience of the individual members of the Management Board and of the \nManagement Board in its entirety. \nResults achieved in the 2024 financial year  \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Management Board comprised two women (20 %) and eight men.  \nThe age structure is diverse, ranging from 49 to 58 years of age as of December 31, 2024. nine years.  \nIn light of the bank’s strategy as a leading European bank with a global reach and a strong home market in Germany, five \nof the ten Management Board members as of December 31, 2024 have a German background. Furthermore, the \nManagement Board members come from Italy, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland. \nHowever, the ethnic diversity of the Management Board does not currently reflect the full diversity of the markets where \nthe bank does business or the diversity of Deutsche Bank’s employees.  \nThe diverse range of the Management Board members’ educational and professional backgrounds includes accounting, \nbanking, business administration, economics, engineering finance, literature, law and philosophy.  \nThe bank transparently reports on Management Board diversity in addition to the information presented in this Corporate \nGovernance Statement according to Sec. 289f and 315d of the German Commercial Code in the sections “Management \nBoard” and “Supervisory Board” as well as on the bank’s website: www.db.com (Heading: Investor Relations, “Corporate \nGovernance”, “Management Board”). \n"}

The Audit Committee has also designated a list of pre-approved audit services that it has \nauthorized the Finance Chief Accounting Office to engage Deutsche Bank’s principal accountant to perform with \nestimated costs in excess of € 1 million. All engagement requests for audit, audit-related and tax services that are not on \nthe pre-approved list of specified services must be approved by the Audit Committee. The Finance Chief Accounting \nOffice periodically reports the engagements approved by it to the Audit Committee. In addition, to facilitate the \nconsideration of engagement requests between its meetings, the Audit Committee has delegated approval authority to \nseveral of its members who are “independent” as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York \nStock Exchange. Such members are required to report any approvals made by them to the Audit Committee at its next \nmeeting. \nAdditionally, United States law and regulations permit the pre-approval requirement to be waived with respect to \nengagements for non-audit services aggregating to no more than five percent of the total amount of revenues the bank \npaid to the principal accountant, if such engagements were not recognized by the bank at the time of engagement and \nwere promptly brought to the attention of the bank’s Audit Committee or a designated member thereof and approved \nprior to the completion of the audit.

Assets which are not \nconsidered in the GAR calculation i.e., exposures to central governments and supranational issuers, central banks \nexposures and trading book are also reported in these tables. Finally, the tables include off-balance sheet exposures for \nfinancial guarantees and assets under management with undertakings subject to NFRD disclosure obligations. The assets \nunder management reflect the total of the in scope Private Bank and Asset Management (DWS) positions. \nTaxonomy eligibility and alignment are assessed for exposures which are included in the GAR numerator. For year-end \n2024, Deutsche Bank is reporting on the Taxonomy eligibility and alignment for the climate change mitigation and \nadaptation objectives, as well as Taxonomy eligibility for the four remaining environmental objectives (water and marine \nresources, circular economy, pollution prevention and control, biodiversity and ecosystems). \nThe tables are duplicated based on the turnover and capex KPIs of the bank’s counterparties for the general purpose \nlending exposures, while exposures with known use of proceeds are presented in both tables in the same way. \nTables 2.1 and 2.2 “GAR sector information” lay out banking book exposures toward the sectors covered by the EU \nTaxonomy compass under the climate change mitigation and adaptation objectives. NACE codes are required to be \npresented at the level 4 and are based on the principal activity of the counterparty. For counterparties which are holding \ncompanies, the NACE sector of the principal activity of the specific counterparty controlled by the holding company is \nconsidered for reporting. The tables are duplicated based on the turnover and capex KPIs of the bank’s counterparties for \nthe general purpose lending exposures. \nTables 3.1 and 3.2 “GAR KPI stock” present the GAR KPIs on the basis of data disclosed in the Tables 1.1 and 1.2 \nrespectively. KPIs in this template reflect the proportion of exposures related to Taxonomy eligible and aligned activities \ncompared to the covered assets. The tables are duplicated based on the turnover and capex KPIs of the bank’s \ncounterparties for the general purpose lending exposures. \nTables 4.1 and 4.2 “GAR KPI flow” highlight the GAR KPIs on flow of new Taxonomy eligible and aligned loans and \nadvances, debt securities and equity instruments to NFRD-relevant undertakings and households in relation to the total \nflow of loans and advances, debt securities and equity instruments to financial and non-financial undertakings and \nhouseholds. The flow data is calculated using gross carrying amount of exposures at origination (i.e., new loans and \nadvances, debt securities, equity instruments) newly incurred between January and December 2024. The tables are \nduplicated based on the turnover and capex KPIs of the bank’s counterparties for the general purpose lending exposures. \nTables 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 “KPI off-balance-sheet exposures” lay out KPIs for off-balance sheet exposures, financial \nguarantees and assets under management, in stock and flow, calculated on the basis of data disclosed in Tables 1.1 and \n1.2 respectively. The assets under management data reflect the total of the in scope Private Bank and Asset Management \n(DWS) positions. As the Disclosure Delegated Acts and Frequently Asked Questions documents from the EU Commission \nprovide no definition of flows for assets under management, Deutsche Bank assesses them based on the net flows in line \nwith the common industry practice of the assets under management reporting. Where net flows were negative in the \nreporting period, resulting EU Taxonomy KPIs are set to zero. \nFinally, nuclear energy and fossil gas tables are used to report on the Taxonomy alignment of exposures to counterparties \nengaged in six nuclear energy and fossil gas activities prescribed in the Complementary Climate Delegated Act EU \n2022/1214. Tables are reported for on balance sheet exposures in scope of GAR stock KPI as well as for off-balance-sheet \nexposures.

For the \nsegments, the applied tax rate was 28% for all report periods in 2024, 2023 and 2022.  \nAt the Group level, tangible shareholders' equity is shareholders’ equity as reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet \nexcluding goodwill and other intangible assets. Tangible shareholders’ equity for the segments is calculated by deducting \ngoodwill and other intangible assets from shareholders’ equity as allocated to the segments. Shareholders’ equity and \ntangible shareholders’ equity are presented on an average basis. \nThe Group believes that a presentation of average tangible shareholders’ equity makes comparisons to its competitors \neasier and refers to this measure in the return on equity ratios presented by the Group. However, average tangible \nshareholders’ equity is not a measure provided for in IFRS, and the Group’s ratios based on this measure should not be \ncompared to other companies’ ratios without considering differences in the calculations. \nThe reconciliation of the aforementioned ratios is set forth in the table below: \n2024 \nin € m. \n(unless stated otherwise) \nCorporate \nBank \nInvestment \nBank \nPrivate \nBank \nAsset \nManagement \nCorporate & \nOther \nTotal \nProfit (loss) before tax \n2,075 \n3,343 \n1,231 \n632 \n(1,989) \n5,291 \nProfit (loss) \n1,494 \n2,407 \n886 \n455 \n(1,737) \n3,505 \nProfit (loss) attributable to \nnoncontrolling interests \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n139 \n139 \nProfit (loss) attributable to DB \nshareholders and additional \nequity components \n1,494 \n2,407 \n886 \n455 \n(1,876) \n3,366 \nProfit (loss) attributable to additional equity \ncomponents \n125 \n264 \n159 \n27 \n93 \n668 \nProfit (loss) attributable to Deutsche Bank \nshareholders \n1,369 \n2,143 \n727 \n428 \n(1,969) \n2,698 \nAverage allocated shareholders' equity1 \n11,682 \n23,672 \n13,990 \n5,329 \n10,089 \n64,763 \nDeduct: Average allocated goodwill and other \nintangible assets1,2 \n776 \n804 \n101 \n2,957 \n2,112 \n6,750 \nAverage allocated tangible shareholders' equity1 \n10,906 \n22,868 \n13,889 \n2,372 \n7,977 \n58,013 \nPost-tax return on average \nshareholders’ equity1 \n11.7% \n9.1% \n5.2% \n8.0% \nN/M \n4.2% \nPost-tax return on average \ntangible shareholders’ equity1 \n12.6% \n9.4% \n5.2% \n18.0% \nN/M \n4.7% \nN/M – Not meaningful \n1 Starting from the first quarter of 2024, the equity allocation framework has been updated.

These standards require the application of the \nInternational Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities according to these regulations and standards are \ndescribed in more detail in the section “Responsibilities of the auditor of the annual financial statements for the \nauditing of the annual financial statements” of our audit opinion. We are independent of the Group in compliance with \nthe Austrian provisions under corporate, special and professional law, and we have met our other professional \nobligations in compliance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained up until the \ndate of this audit certificate is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on this date. \nParticularly important auditing circumstances \nParticularly important auditing circumstances are those circumstances that according to our due discretion were most \nimportant for our auditing of the consolidated annual financial statements of the fiscal year. These matters were \nconsidered in connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and the formulation of our \naudit opinion, and we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters. \nImpairments to loans and advances to customers (expected credit losses) \nCircumstances \nImpairment on credit exposures represents the management’s best estimate of expected credit loss from the credit \nportfolio at the end of the reporting period. \nFor loans and advances to customers in the amount of EUR 14,764.2 million that are valued at amortised cost, \nSteiermärkische Bank und Sparkassen Aktiengesellschaft, Graz, as of 31 December 2024 formed risk provisions in \nthe amount of EUR 418.7 million to cover impairments.  \nTo determine expected credit losses, Steiermärkische Bank und Sparkasse Aktiengesellschaft, Graz, implemented \ninternal guidelines and specific processes. The assumptions and estimates to be made by the management during the \nprocess to determine expected credit losses are complex and are subject to considerable discretionary powers. \nThe models developed and implemented to calculate impairment are specifically for the individual credit portfolios. \nBoth for products and the economic environment, there are country-specific and future-oriented features that are \nrelevant for the respective loss estimate, which results in an increased complexity of models and inputs. The \nuncertainties inherent to the estimate of impairments of loans and advances, in particular the consideration of future \neconomic relationships, are also increased in 2024 due to the geopolitical and economic situation. \nSteiermärkische Bank und Sparkassen Aktiengesellschaft, Graz, has taken this circumstance into account through \ncollective allocation of stages and in-model adjustment (overlays). \nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n"}

In the process, the focus was particularly on the adjustments \nof methods and processes that were applied in order to record the increased uncertainties in the current and future \nenvironment in the expected loan losses. \n• evaluated the control activities in the credit risk management and in the credit business processes and tested key \ncontrols, in particular with regard to credit approval, ongoing monitoring and the early warning system and recorded \nand critically appraised the processes relating to the early detection of default and the UTP assessment (“unlikely to \npay” repayment improbable). \n• evaluated control activities and tested key controls relating to rating models and collateral valuation; \n• evaluated the model governance validation processes and critically appraised the information that was reported to \nthe management. With the aid of our internal experts, we have reviewed the results of backtesting and model \nvalidations. \n• analysed and critically appraised the appropriateness of credit risk parameters and models taking into account \npotential structural breaks of the observable data and assessed the plausibility of expectations and estimates that \nhave been taken based on such distortions to identify significant increases in the credit risk of individual customers \nor of groups of customers. \n• tested the correct stage allocation pursuant to the relevant guidelines for selected portfolios. \n• analysed the sensitivities and effects of the model aspects specific to IFRS 9. \n• evaluated whether key components of the expected credit loss calculation are correctly incorporated into the models \nby conducting walk-throughs and reviewing control tables.. \n• tested the correct calculation of the expected credit losses for selected portfolios. \n• assessed the appropriateness and plausibility of forward-looking information included in the estimates. In the \nprocess, we particularly compared the underlying macroeconomic forecasts with external sources of information and \ncritically appraised the scenario weighting. \n"}

Sufficient certainty is a high degree of certainty but no guarantee that an audit of the \nannual financial statements carried out in compliance with the EU Regulation and the Austrian principles of proper \nauditing that require the application of the ISA always uncovers a fundamental misrepresentation if such exists. \nMisrepresentations can result from fraudulent actions or errors and are seen as fundamental if it could be reasonably \nexpected from them individually or as a whole that they influence the economic decisions taken by users on the basis \nof these consolidated annual financial statements. \nAs part of an audit of financial statements in compliance with the EU Regulation and Austrian generally accepted \nstandards for the audit of financial statements, which require the application of ISA, we exercise due discretion \nthroughout the entire audit and maintain a critical attitude. \n"}

Gross domestic product (GDP) fell (provisionally) by up to 0.9% due to weak developments in \nindustry and construction. In the euro zone, however, GDP increased by 0.8%. \nThe inflation rate in Austria was 2.9%, after 7.8% in 2023, on a yearly average. In the course of the months, however, \ninflation fell substantially so that it was even close to the ECB’s target, at 1.9% in November and 2.0% in December. \nThe high difference in inflation compared to the eurozone was thus no longer an issue. Prices for household energy \nthat fell in a year-by-year comparison slowed inflation most.  \nThe value added of all Austrian sectors developed negatively overall in 2024, at -1.0%. Declining industrial production \n(-4.4%, of which -3.6% in construction) was in contrast to an expansive service sector overall (+0.5%). Financial and \ninsurance services as part of the service sector achieved an increase of +6.1%. Expansion in the transport sector \n(+0.3%) was just above zero. Retail (-2.0%) shrank as it had done in the previous year, whereas agriculture and \nforestry (+3.0%) and the health and social sector (+1.5%) increased. \nThe weak development in Germany encumbered Austria’s foreign trade so that both exports (-2.9%) and imports (-\n2.5%) declined. The current account balance achieved a slightly higher value, at 2.4% of GDP after 1.3% in the prior \nyear. \nThe high level of uncertainty hindered the investments by companies that were -2.9% below the figure for the previous \nyear. Private consumption (-0.3%) also declined as private households only noticed the heavy fall in inflation with \nsome delay and remained frugal despite good increases in collective agreements. \nThe negative economic development also made itself felt on the Austrian labour market. The number of employees in \nactive dependent employment increased by approx. +0.6% to 3,932,059 men and women and the number of \nunemployed and people in training increased perceptibly by +6.8% to 426,012 people. The unemployment rate in \nAustria (according to the Eurostat definition) grew from 5.1% in the provisional yearly average to 5.2% in 2024 (until \nthe status in November) but remained below the comparative figure of the European Union (at a provisional 6.0%). \nAt 6,550 cases, the number of company bankruptcies was significantly higher in 2024 than in 2023 (+22%). Retail, \nconstruction and the hotel and restaurant sectors were the most heavily affected. The number of private bankruptcies \napplied for was slightly higher (+0.8%) than in the previous year, at 8,920 cases. The bankruptcy liabilities were also \nabove the comparative figure of the previous year. \nThe Maastricht limits were substantially exceeded in the public budget and government debt. According to the current \nfigures from the third quarter of 2024, Austria’s public debt amounted to 83.2% of GDP or EUR 398.4 billion in 2024, \nwhereby according to the Maastricht contracts a maximum of 60% is agreed. In the previous year, the comparative \nvalue was EUR 371.7 billion or 78.6% of GDP and thus substantially lower. \nAccording to forecasts, the state’s budget deficit increased in 2024 to (provisionally) 3.7% of GDP; the Maastricht \nobjective is a maximum of 3%. On the income side, consumption taxes developed only very marginally, depending on \nprivate consumption. The elimination of the cold progression and the low corporation tax volume also had a negative \neffect. On the expenditure side, the flood disaster, the construction economy package and higher pension payments \nand staff costs due to inflation led to an additional burden. \nDue to falling inflation and the weak economy in the eurozone, the ECB reduced the deposit rate in four steps in June, \nSeptember, October and December 2024 by 0.25 percentage points in each case, from 4.0% to 3.0% now. Austrian \nbanks’ interest rates rose in 2024, for both lending and the deposit business. In the new business, however, the \nlending interest rates did not increase any further. \nThe banks were able to selectively expand their lending despite the recession. The domestic loan volume increased \nby 1.1%. Corporate financing increased (+1.8%) whereas private loans declined in 2024 (-1.2%). In the case of \nCONSOLIDATED MANAGEMENT REPORT\n"}

Accordingly, the development in bank deposits of retail customers was indeed dynamic \nat 5.3% up until November 2024 as private households were reticent with their consumption as the result of very \nuncertain boundary conditions. In the case of companies, deposits also increased (+0.9%) as investment projects \nwere postponed and liquid funds held back. The loan-to-deposit ratio (domestic customer loans as a percentage of \ndomestic customer deposits) of Austrian banks was stable year-on-year and was 95.4% in November 2024 (2023: \n97.1%).  \nIn its December session, the FMSG (financial market stability committee) recommended to the Financial Market \nAuthority that it leave the Anticyclical Capital Buffer at 0%. Since the entry into force of the Banking Real Estate \nMeasures Regulation (KIM-V), lending standards have substantially improved. Accordingly, the share of defaulted \nresidential mortgages has developed favourably. Together with the increased capitalisation of the banking system, \nthis has helped to ensure that currently there is no system risk from residential mortgages. For this case, an expiry of \nthe regulation is envisaged by law.  \nThe Austrian Traded Index (ATX share index) of the Vienna Stock Exchange increased by 6.6% to 3,663.01 at the end \nof 2024, based on closing prices starting at an index level of 3,434.97 at the end of 2023. \nUp until the 3rd quarter of 2024, the operating result of the Austrian banks was almost 10% lower than in the previous \nyear, at EUR 9.2 billion. The net interest yield was EUR 11.7 billion (-1.5%) and net commission income was EUR 3.8 \nbillion (+7%).  \nAdministrative expenses and other expenses were EUR 8.7 billion and thus 2.9% above the figure for the previous \nyear. Of these, EUR 4.9 billion was attributable to staff expenses, corresponding to an increase of 8.3%. With total \nassets virtually unchanged at EUR 1,021.3 billion, the result for the period (after taxes and minority shareholdings) \nwas EUR 7.1 billion (-20.9% below the previous year). \nReadiness for the green transition \nAs part of Erste Group Bank AG, the Sparkassen are among the leading banks in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) \nand are committed to mobilising finances for a climate-resilient, lower-carbon and fairer society. As one of the first \nmembers of the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), objectives were drawn up for a net-zero portfolio by 2050 and net-\nzero banking operations by 2030. Sustainability is one of the most important pillars of the Sparkassen’s overall \nstrategy. \nThe Sparkassen have examined the environment in which they are active and carried out an analysis in order to \nevaluate the resilience of the Sparkassen’s business model to risks and its readiness for opportunities that arise from \nthe necessary changeover to a lower-carbon economy. In addition, the potential effects, risks and opportunities were \nexamined using a double materiality analysis that arise from climate change and environmental risks. \nAustria is one of the countries with a medium performance in the climate protection index. The successes up to now \nin the area of climate protection, such as the goal to achieve climate neutrality by 2040, are positive. Some of the \nlaws required to curb climate change and for adaptation to climate change (such as the Energy Efficiency Act and the \nAct on Renewable Heating) were adopted in 2023. Unfortunately, Austria is not on a path to achieving its ambitious \ngoal of climate neutrality by 2040. Up to now, the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is not reconcilable with \nAustria’s binding goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the sectors outside of the EU emissions trading \nsystems by 2030 by 36% compared to the previous year. Even taking into account the additional measures that were \nconsidered for the period 2021-2030, the country is running the risk of missing this goal by 9 percentage points. \nBefore 2020, the emission reductions in the energy and industry sector were offset by an increase in the end energy \nconsumption in buildings and in transport that have a considerable potential for reductions in emissions. Currently, \nAustria is an important transit country for road transport crossing the Alps. The reduction of transport-related \nemissions will be particularly important for the transition to carbon neutrality. \n"}

Nevertheless, considerable investments are still required in Austria in order to reach the goal of 100% \nrenewable energies in the electricity consumption by 2030. The share of renewable energies (including bio fuels) in \nthe Austrian energy mix is 34.9%. Austria is above the EU average in the electrification of road transport and the share \nof electrified rail kilometres. The market for emission-free road vehicles is also developing quickly. \nWith regard to the social dimension of the green transition, the guaranteeing of the access to fundamental transport \nand energy services seems to present a lesser challenge in Austria, compared to other Member States. \nThe “Future of Growth” report by the World Economic Forum in January 2024 lists seven archetypes of growth paths \n(A-G). These archetypes of the growth path are not closed groups with precise boundaries; rather, they constitute an \nintuitive approach to emphasising relevant common growth experiences between groups of countries (scores 0-100). \nArchetype A, which Austria belongs to, is characteristic for a group of economies with a high income that are defined \nby a strong performance in the pillars Inclusivity (74.1), Innovative Ability (70.6) and Resilience (66.7). The value of \nthe archetype for sustainability (54.1) is substantially weaker than the performance in the other pillars, and it is also \ncharacterised by a moderate per capital GDP growth of 0.7% in the last five years. The profile of the archetype \nindicates a strong push in the direction of greater inclusivity and innovative ability as well as in the development of \nresilience but, although the sustainability performance is above the global average, there is still potential for further \nprogress. \nThis has the following effects on the Sparkassen: \n1. Net-zero obligation The ambitious goal of the European Union to achieve net zero by 2050 depends on the \ndecarbonisation measures of the individual Member States, in particular in the Central and Eastern European area. \n2. Need for investment: The change required in Austria demands comprehensive investments and risk sharing that \nnecessitate both EU funds and financial assistance from the private sector. \n3. Compliance with statutory regulations: The regulations being further developed on climate change are forcing \ncorporate customers to introduce sustainable practices and to comply with strict environmental standards, which \nrequires considerable adjustments in their processes, supply chains and reporting. The Sparkassen also have to \ncomply with these regulations and to adapt by integrating the new requirements in their business model, improving \ntransparency and implementing robust sustainability strategies. \n4. Energy transition: Fundamental for the decarbonisation of electricity generation, heating and all other energy-\nintensive industries. This will reduce emissions, promote economic growth, drive innovations and create jobs. \n5. Decarbonisation of real estate: The improvement in the energy performance of buildings through renovations is of \ndecisive importance, in particular overcoming challenges such as limited subsidies, financial affordability and technical \nobstacles. \n6. Financial administration: A balance between the speed of the transition and the social/economic costs is of decisive \nimportance. \n7. Overcoming physical risks in own and customer’s portfolio: As river flooding and heat stress constitute considerable \nrisks, the adaptation measures need to be expanded and business opportunities created. On the risk side, the gap in \ninsurance cover needs to be closely monitored and well managed. \n8. Non-environment-related risks: Opportunities arise in areas such as the loss of biodiversity, environmental pollution, \nwaste and water management that offer growth potential for sustainable financing. \n9. Transition and sustainable financing: The growing demand for green bonds and loans and for transition financing, \ntogether with the commitment to sustainable financing, supports the role of the Sparkassen as a pioneer in the \ntransition to a low-carbon economy. \n"}

CRR III enters into force as of \n01.01.2025. In the case of investments and in the output floor for IRB banks, transition deadlines are envisaged. By \nmeans of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2024/2795 of the Commission dated 24.07.2024, the entry into force of the \nown funds requirements for the market risk pursuant to Basel IV (Fundamental Review of the Trading Book) was moved \nfrom 01.01.2025 to 01.01.2026 for competition reasons because Basel IV will be implemented in the US at the earliest \nas of 01.01.2026. \nRegulation (EU) 2022/2554 on digital operational resilience in the financial sector (DORA) entered into force on \n16.01.2023. With DORA, a harmonised and comprehensive legal framework for the digital operational resilience of \nEuropean financial companies is being introduced. The specifications of DORA are to be implemented by the \ncompanies concerned, and thus also by the Sparkassen, by 17.01.2025. \nRegulation (EU) 2024/886 amending Regulations (EU) No 260/2012 and (EU) 2021/1230 and Directives 98/26/EC \nand (EU) 2015/2366 with regard to real-time transfers in EUR entered into force on 08.04.2024. With it, payment \nservice providers such as banks offering conventional transfers pursuant to the SEPA Regulation (Regulation (EU) \n260/2012) are obligated to also offer real-time transfers in EU (receipt and sending). For payment service providers \nin Euro Member States, and thus also for the Sparkassen the provisions in this regard for the receiving of real-time \ntransfers apply from 09.01.2025 and for the sending of real-time transfers from 09.10.2025. \nSince 01.08.2022, the KIM-V of the FMA has continued to apply, with which borrower-based award quotas are \nstipulated to the banks in the case of private housing financing. The amendment of the KIM-V with the simplification \nto an exception quota entered into force as of 01.07.2024; the use and control of the exception quota was thus \nsimplified. At the beginning of December 2024, the FMSG recommended allowing the KIM-V to expire as of \n30.06.2025. At the beginning of October 2024, the FMSG recommended to the FMA that a system risk buffer pursuant \nto Section 23e BWG be determined for the sub-risk item Commercial mortgages (sectoral system risk buffer) in the \namount of 1% of these risk items on consolidated and unconsolidated level as of 01.07.2025. The new buffer \nspecifications that are implemented in the FMA capital buffer regulation are to apply from 01.07.2025. The FMSG will \nevaluate the need for further increases in the sectoral system risk buffer in conjunction with the effects of the CRR III \non the capital requirements of the banks in the third quarter of 2025. \nThe implementation of the directive on class action suits to protect the collective interests of the consumers (Directive \n(EU) 2020/1828) in Austrian law was done with a delay, with the Class Action Suit Directive Implementation \nAmendment which entered into force on 18.07.2024. Class action suits on consumer protection according to the new \nprovisions can be filed by so-called Qualified Institutions and be directed at both cease-and-desist and remedy \n(performance or organisation). The possibilities for collective legal prosecution that have already existed up to now \n(such as law suits pursuant to Sections 28 et seq. KSchG and 14 UWG) will continue to exist in parallel. The \nimplications of the new possibilities for class action suits on businesses, including the banks, will be shown in practice; \nthe class action for remedy is a new instrument of appeal that has not yet been tested in court. \nIn addition, the new directive on consumer loans (Directive (EU) 2023/2225) that replaces the predecessor directive \n(Directive 2008/48 EC) in full is to be implemented in Austrian law by 20.11.2025 (with application from 20.11.2026). \nIn the interest of consumer protection, the new specifications for consumer loans make provision, for example, for \nincreased information obligations, certain advertising bans, a more comprehensive regulation of credit checks or the \nobligation of banks to offer appropriate forbearance measures before initiating foreclosure proceedings. \nOn 28.06.2024, in the course of a VAT appeal proceeding by an institute outside the sector, the Federal Financial \nCourt (BFG), regarding the second sentence of Section 6 Par. 1 Clause 28 of the UStG directed an EU reference for a \npreliminary ruling to the ECJ; this reference relates to whether this part of the provision concerns aid that is \nimpermissible under EU law. The substantiation from the BFG is that this part of the provision does not have any basis \nunder EU law in the VAT System Directive (MwStSyStRL) and an interpretation contra legem is not permitted. In the \nrun-up to this EU reference for a preliminary ruling, the legislator amended the legal situation with the entry into force \nfrom 01.01.2025 in the course of the Tax Amendment Act 2024 (Federal Law Gazette [BGBl. I 2024/113) and deleted \nthe second sentence of Section 6 Para. 1 Clause 28 of the VAT Act (UStG).

The biggest contributing factor here again was payment transactions, generating income of \nEUR 117.2 million in total (up +8.6%). Commissions in the security business increased by 9.2% to EUR 43.5 billion.  \nThe period result from bonds in companies measured at equity increased by 6.0% to EUR 126.7 million (EUR 119.5 \nmillion). The biggest contribution here is again provided by the proportionate result from the Croatian subsidiary bank \n(Erste & Steiermärkische Bank d.d) of EUR 101.1 million (EUR 98.9 million). \nThis results in an increase in the operating income by EUR 41.8 million (+4.7%) to EUR 935.0 million (EUR 893.2 \nmillion): \nPersonnel costs increased by 5.5% to EUR 175.4 million compared to the previous year (EUR 166.2 million). This is \nattributable in particular to the inflation-driven increases in wage costs.  \nThere was an increase in costs due to inflation in virtually all areas. Overall, this resulted in an increase in material \ncosts by 2.0% from EUR 108.9 million to EUR 111.0 million. Fundamental influencing factors were, on the one hand, \nthe increase in the IT costs (+ EUR 5.5 million) and on the other hand, the fall in marketing costs. In the previous year, \nthis included extraordinary expense (EUR 2.4 million) in connection with the formation of a provision for the young \nfamily bonus advertised in connection with residential mortgages. After the deposit protection fund is now endowed \nas of 30.06.2024 above the statutory requirement, the costs for the deposit protection were -36.6% lower than in \nthe previous year, at EUR 7.5 million. \nOverall, this resulted in operating earnings of EUR 619.0 million, an increase of 5.4% from EUR 587.4 million.  \nWith the valuation result for securities and participating interests, a decline by EUR 5.1 million to EUR 5.8 million (EUR \n10.9 million) results due to the effects of the fair value valuation. \nIn the other operating result in the total amount of EUR 5.8 million (EUR 5.2 million), in particular the results of the \nvaluation of the participations in the subsidiary banks in Southeast Europe were included. Compared to the previous \nyear (EUR 4.0 million), there was an increased need for appreciation, primarily due to the appreciation in the Slovenian \nsubsidiary bank (Banka Sparkasse d.d.) in the amount of EUR 9.6 million.

In the \ncustomer business, the loans and receivables from customers only posted a moderate increase by +2.2% to EUR 15.3 \nbillion due to the continued reticent demand for loans in Austria.  \nThe cost-to-income ratio (CIR) improved further to 33.8% (34.2%). \nDevelopment in Austria  \nAs in previous years, the Group parent Steiermärkische Bank und Sparkassen AG, with total assets (according to \nIFRS) of EUR 20.0 billion, accounts for the largest share of consolidated total assets of EUR 22.5 billion. The effective \ngrowth in total assets of +5.3% is primarily attributable to the volume increases in customer deposits (+3.8%) and in \ncustomer loans (+1.3%). \nThe very positive development of business overall in 2024 produces a period result (according to IFRS) in the amount \nof EUR 497.0 million (EUR 496.0 million).  \nThe interest surplus developed pleasingly despite the reduced interest rate level and amounted to EUR 461.7 million \n(EUR 443.4 million). \nThe commission surplus increased to EUR 176.6 million, an increase of 8.5% on the comparison figure of the previous \nyear (EUR 162.8 million). The biggest contributing factor here again was payment transactions, generating income of \nEUR 96.1 million in total (up +10.5%). The commission result in the securities business was increased compared to \nthe previous year by 9.1% or EUR 3.6 million.  \nWith the valuation result for securities and participating interests, a decline by EUR 4.4 million to EUR 7.1 million (EUR \n11.6 million) results due to the effects of the fair value valuation. \nThe proportionate period result of subsidiaries and associates measured at the proportionate equity increased by EUR \n15.7 million to EUR 170.9 million. \nOverall, this resulted in an increase in the operating income by EUR 47.7 million to EUR 838.5 million (+6.0%). \nOperating costs increased by 4.7% from EUR 239 million to EUR 250.2 million.  \nPersonnel expenditure (EUR 135.5 million/+4.9%), but also material costs (EUR 103.6 million/+5.4%) increased \nparticularly due to increased costs due to inflation. \nOverall, this results in operating earnings of EUR 588.3 million (previous year EUR 551.9 million), which equates to a \n6.6% increase. \nThe loss allowances for customer loans increased to EUR 70.6 million (-EUR 25.7 million) and are characterised above \nall by the substantial inflows in the problem loan portfolio. \nIn the other operating result in the total amount of EUR 59.8 million (EUR 60.8 million), in particular the results of the \nvaluation of the participations in the subsidiary banks in Southeast Europe were posted with a revaluation gain in the \n"}

The \nbank therefore held an unchanged closing stock of 597 treasury shares on 31.12.2024. \nCorporate social responsibility  \nThere is no co-existence without responsibility for one another. This applies for any form of relationship, including the \nrelationship of a company to society. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) denotes precisely this responsibility that \ncompanies assume for society. Steiermärkische Sparkasse has been living this philosophy since 1825 and also links \nspecific goals to it, namely sustainable value creation and capital protection for its customers.  \nThis is only possible if two prerequisites are met: Firstly, the opportunities and risks need to be taken into account that \narise from the economic, ecological and social boundary conditions. Secondly, the aim is to incorporate all relevant \ninterest groups. These are in particular customers, employees and business partners. \nCorporate Social Responsibility is closely associated with the concept of sustainability. In 2021, the Management \nBoard decided to adopt a holistic sustainability strategy that takes effect precisely there and incorporates the three \npillars economy, ecology and social matters. The logical areas for action are derived from these: environment, \nemployees, customers as well as society and Corporate Governance. The sustainability strategy was adapted in 2024 \nand in particular adjusted due to the result of the double materiality analysis conducted within the framework of the \nproject to implement the CSRD.  \nEach area of action of the sustainability strategy covers topics that are driven forward by specific goals, measures \nand activities. Clearly defined goals and the permanent review of the goals and processes define the path into the \nfuture. This thus also ensures that Steiermärkische Sparkasse can comply with the specifications of the Sustainability \nand Diversity Improvement Act, whereby Steiermärkische Sparkasse is currently still included in the consolidated non-\nfinancial declaration of ERSTE Group Bank AG. After the transposing of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting \nDirective (CSRD) in Austrian law (NaBeG), it is to be assumed that Steiermärkische Sparkasse is obligated to create \nits own non-financial declaration. \nSustainability is also an important component in investment decisions. \"Sustainable finance\" means offering \nsustainable products both in investment and in financing. But it also means even more, namely advising and supporting \ncustomers when they want to integrate sustainability in their financial decisions or accompanying them in \ntransformation processes.  \nHowever, creating values, and doing so in a responsible manner, does not only affect individual investments. It \nconcerns \nthe \ngeneral \npublic \ntoo. \nin \n2024, \nSteiermärkische \nSparkasse \nalong \nwith \nSteiermärkische \nVerwaltungssparkasse supported numerous projects and initiatives in the areas of art, culture, social matters as well \nas education and science, and did so not only in Styria but also in the Western Balkan countries that are part of the \nextended domestic market.  \nA modern bank facilitates opportunities and finances dreams, for customers as well as employees. Consequently, \nbeing an employer means more than paying at market conditions and based on performance. It means recognising \nand fulfilling requirements and wishes, particularly for young people. These include opportunities for initial and further \ntraining and clearly agreed goals with assessment meetings (Management by Objectives). The basis for this is the \ncareer model introduced at the parent company Steiermärkische Bank und Sparkasse AG in 2015. It is based, among \nothers, on function-based payment instead of fixed bonuses and puts the focus of remuneration on performance and \nresponsibility. In addition, Steiermärkische Bank und Sparkasse AG offers numerous seminars, workshops and \nconsultations in the area of health management that can be readily used by employees. \n \n"}

Nevertheless, the continuous \nfurther development of the offerings and services, based on current innovations such as in the digital field, has a \npivotal place in the company.  \nEven if the business activity does not cause any direct negative influences on the environment, ecology is a significant \ncomponent of the company's policy. Ecological responsibility means for instance, that the Steiermärkische Sparkasse \nGroup meets the Energy Efficiency Act, which entered into force in 2015, beyond the statutory minimum requirement. \nIn addition, the parent company Steiermärkische Bank und Sparkassen AG has had a certified environmental \nmanagement system according to ISO 14001 since November 2015 and this is continually being developed further. \nRisk management  \nWith regard to the explanations of the risks and the goals and methods in the risk management, reference is made to \nthe statements in the notes (Note 29). \nInternal control and risk management system for the Group accounting process  \nGeneral \nThe \"Internal Control System\" (ICS) denotes processes designed by the company management and implemented in \nthe company by means of which \n the effectiveness and economic efficiency of operating activities (including the protection of assets from loss due \nto damage or misappropriation), \n the reliability of financial reporting and \n compliance with the statutory regulations relevant for the company  \nare monitored and checked. \nThe risk management incorporates all processes that serve to identify, analyse and evaluate risks and to take \nmeasures that prevent the attainment of the company's goals being impaired by fundamental risks that arise.  \nAccording to the internationally recognised COSO framework (COSO – Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \nTreadway Commission – is a voluntary private-sector organisation in the USA that aims to help improve the quality of \nfinancial reporting through ethical action, effective internal controls and good corporate governance) for the \norganisation of risk management systems, the ICS is to be understood as part of a company-wide risk management \nsystem. These also include the management and the control of risks that relate to the correctness and reliability of \nthe accounting. \nTaking into account the COSO framework and the 3 Lines of Defense model, the ICS policy stipulates the general \nframework conditions for the Internal Control System, the standards for tasks and responsibilities and the minimum \ncriteria for the ICS documentation. The objective of the internal control system is to assist management to enable it \nto ensure effective and continuously improving internal controls with regard to the objectives of the ICS described \nabove. \nControl environment \nThe control environment represents the framework for the introduction, application and monitoring of ICS principles, \nprocedures and measures. The Management Board is responsible for the setting up, configuration and application of \nan internal control and risk management system that is appropriate to the company's requirements with regard to the \naccounting process. \nThe organisational structure provides for a clear profile of requirements for Accounting operations. In the process, \ncross-divisional key functions are controlled centrally via Steiermärkische Sparkasse, whereby at the same time the \nindividual subsidiaries have a high degree of autonomy. The functions of departments substantially involved in the \nfinancial reporting process are clearly separated and responsibilities are clearly allocated. \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 20, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n19\nIn addition, fundamental subsidiaries have their own accounting departments that work in close consultation with the \nAccounting division. The responsibilities of the Accounting division incorporate primarily the creation of the individual \nand consolidated annual and interim financial statements as well as the annual financial statements of some \nsubsidiaries, the financial accounting and the transfer pricing, taxes and reporting pursuant to supervisory law. The \nAccounting division is responsible for the regulatory competence regarding all questions of accounting and the \nspecialist instruction authority to ensure the application of standards that are uniform throughout the Group. To \nsupport the operational implementation, Group guidelines have been drawn up by the Erste Group that are to be \napplied for the entire savings bank sector. These guidelines apply for all consolidated subsidiaries of the \nSteiermärkische Sparkasse Group. \nRisk assessment  \nThe key processes in the Accounting division are subjected to an annual risk evaluation and risk assessment within \nthe framework of the ICS process. The main risk in the financial reporting process is that issues are not presented in \na manner consistent with the financial position and financial performance due to error or intent (fraud). This is the \ncase when the information in the statement of financial position, income statement and notes deviates substantially \nfrom the correct values and can entail serious consequences such as financial damage, penalties imposed by the \nbanking authority, or loss or reputation. \nControl measures \nWith regard to the financial reporting process, the internal control and risk management system includes operating \ninstructions and processes for:  \n the correct and appropriate documentation of business transaction, including the use of the Group assets, \n the recording of all information necessary to draw up annual financial statements and \n to prevent non-approved acquisitions or sales that could have a fundamental effect on the annual financial \nstatements. \nThe following are deemed to be elementary components of the Internal Control System within the Steiermärkische \nSparkasse Group: \n Controlling as the permanent financial and business analysis and management of the company or individual company \ndivisions,  \n Automatic control facilities and measures that are intrinsic to the system in the formal process organisation and \norganisational structure, e.g. programmed checks in data processing or downstream checks indicated in an ICS tool.  \n separation of functions and dual control principles; \n Internal Audit – as an independent organisational unit – that monitors all departments, particularly with regard to the \neffectiveness of components of the internal control system, and strives to do so independently of processes, yet as \nclose to operations as possible.  \nThe accounting of Steiermärkische Sparkasse and the main domestic subsidiaries as well as the subsidiary banks in \nNorth Macedonia and Bosnia is carried out in SAP FI. The closing data transmitted by the foreign Group entities directly \ninto the consolidation system are first checked for plausibility in the Accounting division. The further consolidation \nsteps are then done in the consolidation system (TAGETIK). These incorporate, among others, the capital consolidation, \nthe consolidation of expenses and income, as well as debt consolidation. Fundamental interim gains through Group \npostings are then eliminated. Subsequently, the preparation of the notes in accordance with IFRS and the \nBankwesengesetz (BWG – Austrian Federal Banking Act) and Unternehmensgesetzbuch (UGB – Austrian Commercial \nCode) constitutes the conclusion of consolidation. In-house solutions are also used for the preparation of these \ndisclosures and the editing and layout of the notes. The accounting systems and the upstream applications are \nprotected by access authorisations and automatic control steps as well as manual steps that are envisaged as \nmandatory in the process. \nThrough the obligation of all Group companies (all domestic and foreign banks and financial institutions) to report their \nactual and forecast results to the Accounting and Controlling and ALM divisions during the year on a monthly basis, \ndeviations between plan and actual figures during the year are recognised in a timely manner and there is the \nopportunity to respond accordingly. \n"}

Other controlling and risk data are also provided. \nThe Management Board receives this information on a monthly basis with additional detailed reports and also the \nstatement of financial position and income statement pursuant to the Austrian Commercia Code (UGB). \nResponsibilities of Internal Auditing  \nInternal Audit must check and assess all departments within the bank at appropriate intervals on the basis of audit \npriorities selected with a focus on risk (in accordance with the annual audit plan approved by the Management Board \nand reported to the Audit Committee). The priority of all audit procedures is to monitor the internal control system’s \nproper functioning. Internal Audit has to report its findings several times a year to the whole Management Board and \nthe Audit Committee. \nIn accordance with section 42 BWG, Internal Audit is a control body that reports directly to the Management Board. It \nis used solely for the ongoing and comprehensive auditing of the lawfulness, correctness and expediency of the bank \nbusiness and bank operations. It is therefore the task of Internal Audit to support the Management Board in securing \nthe bank’s assets and promoting its economic and operating performance, thus supporting the Management Board in \nits business and operating policy. Internal Audit’s activities are oriented in particular towards its rules of procedure, \ndeveloped under the responsibility of all Management Board members and approved and implemented by them. The \nrules of procedure are checked regularly and as warranted, and adapted when necessary.  \nIn particular, Internal Audit reviews: \n the bank’s operating and business departments \n the bank’s operating and business processes \n bank-internal regulations (organisational guidelines, allocations of competencies, guidelines, etc.) and work \ninstructions, also with regard to their compliance and topicality and/or updating. \n audit areas as determined by law, e.g. accuracy and comprehensiveness of the content of reports and notifications \nto the financial market authority and the OeNB/European Central Bank, plus rating systems and their functionality \nonce per year. \nInternal Audit operates at its own discretion and in accordance with the audit plan, which is prepared annually on the \nbasis of risk and approved by the Management Board. The Audit Committee is also informed about the approved audit \nplan.  \nInternal Audit is monitored and audited by the Management Board, the Audit Committee/Supervisory Board, by \nexternal parties (banking authority, in individual cases also by auditors of the financial statements), and via clear \nquality assurance measures (self-assessments, peer reviews, external quality assessments). \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 22, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n21\nReport on the expected development of the company  \nBoundary conditions in light of the geopolitical crisis in Europe \nAfter the reference date for the statement of financial position (31.12.2024), the majority of the risks for the growth \nforecasts are directed upwards. As in the prior year, the risks include unsolved conflicts such as in the Gaza Strip and \nthe ongoing war in Ukraine. The downward risks also include the weak economy in China and the tensions with the \nUS with regard to the promised more restrictive customs policy. At the same time, European fiscal rules could result \nin a rapid consolidation of public budgets in several countries and slow the economy further. In Austria, a longer-\nlasting recession in industry coupled with an even greater increase in corporate bankruptcies could lead to a greater \nlay-off of personnel. The resulting higher unemployment could slow the forecast moderate economic upturn which is \nfundamentally sustained by the consumption expenses of private households.  \nHowever, to date, no events are known after the reference date for the statement of financial position that would have \nresulted in a different depiction of the 2024 annual financial statements. \nIn the basic scenario, the current forecasts by the Economic Research Institute (WIFO) and the Institute for Higher \nStudies (IHS) assume that growth in Austrian GDP will return in 2025 again to a low but positive growth path, at a \nmaximum +0.7%. Fundamental reasons are impulses from abroad and the economic package at home, which \nconstruction investments should profit from. In 2026, the forecasts are assuming further economic recovery (GDP \nmaximum +1.3%). \nInflation already fell substantially in 2024. According to forecasts, a further reduction to between 2.3% and 2.6% is \nprobable in 2025. There will be an attainment of the target figure of the ECB of nearly 2.0% from 2026 onwards. \nThe situation on the labour market remained relatively stable in 2024 despite the recession. According to the WIFO \nforecast, the unemployment rate should be 5.4% in 2025 (according to the Eurostat definition) and slightly decline to \n5.2% in 2026. In the forecast, the IHS assumes 5.5% (2025) and 5.2% (2026).  \nIn the banking market, the growth forecast of the IHS 2025 for loans is at +1.2% lower than with deposits, at +2.0%. \nCompanies are barely investing and accordingly, the demand for loans is weak. Private households are reticent with \ntheir consumption, which is why the savings quota is high and favours growth in deposits and/or also (early) \nrepayments of private loans. In 2026, the increase in the credit volume should remain moderate, at +1.3%. With \ndeposits, an increase of only +0.6% is forecast. \nAlthough the ECB does not communicate any specific information on future interest rate decisions, representatives of \nthe monetary and capital markets are assuming that there will be a further three reductions in interest rates in 2025, \ntotalling 75 base points. The reason for this is the strongly declining inflation rate in the euro zone. \n \nAnticipated development of the company  \nIn its planning assumptions, Steiermärkische Sparkasse assumed that the three-month Euribor on an annual average \nin 2025 will fall substantially in accordance with the interest rate policy of the ECB. Falling interest rates should have \na correspondingly positive effect for investors in securities. This under the assumption that share prices will only \nfluctuate within the framework of the conventional volatility, but not fall in the long term. Steiermärkische Sparkasse \nis thus planning higher commission results in the securities business in 2025 too. In payment transactions, the \nSparkasse also sees increasing potential for income which results from a higher number of customers and the price \nincreases from indexings.  \nWith deposits, Steiermärkische Sparkasse, in line with the strong increase in the savings quota to 11.4%, initially sees \na continuing dynamic volume development on the market. A fundamental reason for this is the weak consumption \nwillingness of the private households who are frugal in situations of high economic uncertainty. In the corporate \nsegment, the cumulated liquidity does not initially flow into investments that quickly. At the earliest from 2026 onwards, \nSteiermärkische Sparkasse is assuming lower deposit growth again in line with assumptions regarding lower interest \nrates. \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 23, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n22\nWith receivables from customers, the goal continues to be to expand growth in the planning period slightly above the \nmarket. That is why gains in market shares are strived for both in the retail but also in the commercial division. With \nresidential mortgages, a further recovery of the demand for mortgages is to be anticipated, whereby the lower interest \nrates and the housing package of the government provide corresponding support. A certain downward risk results \nfrom the construction of new apartments that would be delayed even further in a recession. In the case of consumer \nloans, it is planned to achieve the pre-pandemic level again after the lows in the previous years. Steiermärkische \nSparkasse would like to continue to support corporate customers in financing the real economy. However, the credit \nvolume should only now grow in the low one-digit percentage range.  \nIn 2025, on the expenses side, Steiermärkische Sparkasse is planning an increase in the personnel costs due to the \nincreases set out in the collective agreements that will be oriented to the inflation rate of 2024.  \nThe planned operating result in 2025 is planned to be lower than the figure for the previous year due to the decline in \nthe interest surplus, despite the ambitious plan for commissions. \nThe increased risk costs in 2025 are associated with the upward trend in insolvencies and the weak economic outlook. \nWith the increasing stabilisation of the economy in the further course of the planning period, it is assumed that the \nrisk costs will level off a normal level again. \nIn the 2025 fiscal year too, the aim is to grow continuously and risk-consciously on the basis of the existing business \nmodel. The activities aimed at customer acquisition will continue to be pursued with unchanged intensity.  \nA fundamental success factor here will be the further integration of new technologies in the business model and sales \nconcept of Steiermärkische Sparkasse. A decisive added value is to be created for customers through intelligent \nlinking of digital services and personal consultation. Here, the focus is on the financial health of all customers. It is our \naspiration to make a financially self-determined life possible for people. Long-standing customer relationships and \npartnerships are key factors here for success. \nThe expansion of Private Banking into a competence focus area will continue to be consistently pursued at the Group \nparent in Austria. \nA special focus will continue to be placed on the active support of transformation processes and investments for more \nsustainability and the best possible accompaniment of our customers on this path. In the Commercial business, a \nspecial focus is on the financing of investments for the growth-oriented transformation of the business model. \nIn total, a balanced growth in all sectors is strived for. \nA negative scenario for 2025 would be a continuation of the recession. However, the very high capital base and the \ngood liquidity situation of Steiermärkische Sparkasse make it possible to counter the uncertain boundary conditions \nand to be a reliable partner for the customers and people in the region in the future too. In the entire planning period, \nthe capital quotas have sufficient buffer, both towards the regulatory minimum requirements to be anticipated and \nalso to the higher internal target figures. \nFormation of risk provisions  \nThe special risks of the credit business is being taken into appropriate account by the formation of risk provisions (loss \nallowances for statement of financial position credit transactions and provisions for off-balance-sheet credit \ntransactions). The formation of risk provisions must correspond to the guidelines according to IFRS 9.  \nIn the process, the expected loss will be determined for receivables not classified as impaired either as a 1-year \nexpected credit loss (Stage 1) or as a lifetime expected credit loss (Stage 2). Financial instruments when recorded for \nthe first time and/or financial instruments without a significant increase in the credit risks since they were recorded \nfor the first time are assigned to Stage 1; however, financial instruments with a significant increase of the credit risk \nsince they were recorded for the first time and financial instruments without sufficient information about when they \nwere recorded for the first time are assigned to Stage 2. The determination whether there , is a significant increase in \nthe credit risk since initial recognition will be determined by the review of qualitative and quantitative criteria. \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 24, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n23\nQuantitative criteria are the relative or absolute change in the current annualised Lifetime PD (probability of default) \nof the financial instrument compared to the annualised Lifetime PD to the time of accrual of the financial instrument. \nQualitative criteria are e.g. the handover of the customer to Workout, the setting of a forbearance status or overdrawn \nby more than 30 days. \nThe risk provisions for defaulted receivables from customers are calculated generally on the individual customer level. \nThe individual method is used in material defaulted customer receivables and consists of an individual determination \nof the reorganisation or resolution scenarios currently seen as possible, their probabilities of occurrence and the return \nflows to be expected depending on the scenario (repayments and collateral income) by the workout risk manager. The \npresent value results from the discounting of the expected payment streams with the original effective interest rate. \nThe necessary risk provision results from the difference between gross carrying value and the present value of the \nexpected payment streams in a scenario, calculated across all probability-weighted scenarios. A customer who has \ndefaulted is classified as significant if the entire receivables and off-balance-sheet items are above a certain \nmateriality threshold. \nOtherwise, the customer is classified as insignificant, whereby a rule-based approach is taken for the calculation of \nthe risk provision. Statistically determined risk parameters are used for the anticipated loss of a customer classified \nas “insignificant”, depending on the duration of the default and the status in the restructuring and resolution process, \nthe potential restructuring or resolution scenarios, their probabilities of occurrence and the return flows to be expected \nwith these. \nFor all receivables for which there is no impairment, a formula-based calculation of the individual expected loss (at the \nlevel of financial instruments), taking into account the expected return flows, is used, based on statistically determined \nrisk parameters. \nOn the basis of future-oriented information, current circumstances and forward-looking information (in particular \nregarding current macroeconomic scenarios), new evaluations of the risk parameters are being made. \nDue to multiple crises in the last few years and their different effects on economic development, a collective \nassessment of the significant increase in the credit risk (stage overlays) was applied at the end of December 2024 in \naddition to the standard appraisal of future-related information. This led to a shift in Stage 2 on the basis of predefined \nportfolio characteristics. This approach was agreed in the Sparkassen sector and approved by the respective \nmanagement committees of the Sparkasse. Exceptions to the collective assessment of the significant increase in the \ncredit risk were necessary if special characteristics were established and it was duly documented why they behave \ndifferently to the rest of the portfolio. \nCertain industry sectors are susceptible to the upheavals of the current environment of multiple crises with geopolitical \nand macroeconomic shocks. The continuing high inflation and the reduction in available income continue to slow \nprivate consumption, whereas the great global uncertainty and the high refinancing conditions are having negative \neffects on investments and industrial activity. Whereas certain sectors have developed robustly, others still see \nthemselves confronted with high warehouse stocks, ongoing problems in the supply chain and a cost inflation as well \nas additionally lower demand. \nThe rules for the stage overlay (industry overlay) were defined as a combination of sectors with a high risk profile \n(according to industry strategy) or medium risk profile and a hold/decrease strategy as well as a threshold value of \n250 base points with the one-year default probabilities according to UGB/IFRS.  \nThe measurement of the credit risk for the effects of climate change is done firstly via the LGD models, whereby the \nclimate risk is reflected indirectly via the collateral value and secondly ESG factors are taken into account in the \nvaluation of the soft facts in the company rating models. As of 31 December 2024, in addition, no collective \nassessment of the significant increase in the credit risk (stage overlays) is deemed to be necessary. \n"}

The reason for the constant overfulfilment of the strict \nregulatory specifications are the primary deposits which are developing pleasingly based on the strong customer \nrelationships and the investment in high-quality securities and Central Bank deposits that serve as liquidity buffer. In \naddition to a balanced ratio between customer deposits and customer receivables, a good structural refinancing \nstructure between banks is the focus of the liquidity management. \n \nNet assets \nThe net asset position of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group continued to improve. \nThe own funds of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group amount to EUR 3,357.1 million. The own funds comprise Tier \n1 and Tier 2 capital. \nTier 1 capital (CET 1) is EUR 3,343.8 million and the Additional Tier 1 capital (AT 1) is EUR 0.0 million. Tier 2 capital \n(T2) amounts to EUR 13.3 million. \nThe Tier 1 capital ratio is 27.5% (24.4%), again way above the minimum requirements. \nReport on branches  \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group has a total of 195 branches and regional consultation centres (without self-\nservice locations), of which 119 are in Styria, 1 in Vienna, 39 in Bosnia and 36 in North Macedonia. In addition, there \nare 36 self-service locations in Styria. \nAs of the year-end, 2,610 (2,614) bank operations staff were employed in the branches and regional consultation \ncentres of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group (less leased staff). \n \n \n \n"}

The Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group intends to apply these changes early in 2025. \nThe changes of IFRS 9 make it possible for a company to view a financial liability that is settled via an electronic \npayment system as settled before the date of fulfilment. In addition, they include clarifications for the classification of \nfinancial assets in the areas: contractual conditions that are in line with an elementary loan agreement, financial assets \nthat are not eligible for recourse and contractually linked instruments. The changes of IFRS 7 bring new disclosure \nobligations for investments in equity instruments that are valued at the fair value without impact on income, and for \ncontractual conditions that can change the point in time or the amount of the contractual cashflows. \nThe changes to IFRS 9 will lead to a different SPPI valuation of financial assets whose interest rates will be adjusted \nbased on the fulfilment of certain ESG-based goals by the debtors. The Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group will no \nlonger assess them according to whether the effects of adjustments are minor but whether the adjusted cashflows \ncould deviate materially from the contractual cashflows without such a contingent function. It is not expected that the \nnew assessment will change the valuation of the financial assets concerned. The other changes to IFRS 9 are not \nexpected to have any significant effects on the consolidated financial statements of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse \nGroup. Changes to IFRS 7 will lead to new disclosures. \nAnnual improvements, volume 11 In July 2024, the IASB adopted and published a number of various amendments \nto existing standards. The amendments to IFRS 1, IFRS 7, IFRS 9, IFRS 10 and IAS 7 are to be applied for fiscal years \nbeginning on or after 1 January 2026. The adoption of these amendments is not expected to have a significant effect \non the consolidated financial statements of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group. \n \n \n"}

Interest surplus \nThe interest surplus is broken down into interest income, other similar income, income costs and other similar costs. \nThe decisive factor for the allocation to these items is whether the effective interest method is mandatorily to be \napplied for the recording of interest income and expenses pursuant to IFRS 9. \n\"Interest income\" relates to income from interest from financial assets at amortised cost and of financial assets rated \nat the fair value with no impact on profit or loss. They are recorded using the effective interest method, as described \nin the chapter \"Financial instruments - Fundamental accounting principles\". \nThe item \"Other similar income\" includes interest-like income that result from non-derivative financial assets that are \nvalued at fair value with an impact on income or loss, derivatives held for trading purposes, hedge accounting \nderivatives, receivables from financing leasing and negative interest from financial liabilities. The negative interest \nfrom financial liabilities also includes fees that are charged on deposits by business customers on the basis of a certain \npercentage of the outstanding balances. \nThe item \"Interest expenses\" relates to interest expenses from financial liabilities valued at amortised cost and which \nare calculated using the effective interest method. This is described in the chapter \"Financial instruments - \nFundamental accounting principles”. \nThe item \"Other similar expenses” includes interest-like expenses that result from non-derivative financial liabilities \nthat are valued at fair value with an impact on income or loss, derivatives held for trading purposes, hedge accounting \nderivatives, negative interest from financial assets, leasing liabilities, IFRS 9 and IAS 37 provisions (consideration of \nthe fair value of the money through mere expiry) as well as net obligations from pension plans according to IAS 19 \n(net interest costs on severance, pension and anniversary provisions). \nInterest income and other similar income include interest income from loans and advances to banks and customers, \nfrom cash in hand and balances as well as from bonds of all valuation categories of financial assets, from trade \nreceivables and other receivables and from receivables from financing leasing. Interest expenses and other similar \nexpenses include, in addition to interest expenses for deposits of banks and customers, also interest expenses for \nissued bonds and for other financial liabilities of all valuation categories and interest expenses from leasing obligations. \nIn addition, the interest surplus includes interest from derivative financial instruments. \nIn addition, modification gains and losses from financial assets in Stage 1 are indicated in the interest income. \nFurthermore, the not yet amortised amount of the origination fees/transaction costs that were included in the effective \ninterest rate is recognised in interest income on the derecognition of assets in Stages 1 and 2 on the date of \nderecognition. \n"}

Net fee and commission income \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group receives fee and commission income from various services that it performs for \ncustomers. Commission income is measured on the basis of the consideration specified in the contract with the \ncustomer. The Steiermärkische Sparkasse records this income if it transfers a promised service to individual customers.  \nCommissions from the provision of services over a certain period of time are assigned to the corresponding period of \ntime. This includes commissions from credit commitments, liability commissions and other commissions from the \ncredit business, commission income from the asset management, the custodian business and other management and \nconsulting fees as well as fees from the insurance brokerage business and the building society brokerage business. \nThe payments that are made over a certain period of time also include payment transaction services such as periodic \ncard fees. \nCommission income from the implementation of transaction-related services for third parties, such as the acquisition \nand sale of shares or other securities for customers or foreign exchange transactions as well as brokerage \ncommissions from services such as the sale of fund or insurance products will be recorded after the completion of the \nrespective transaction. The transaction-based payments also include payment transaction services such as \nwithdrawal fees. \nA contract with a customer that results in the recognition of a financial instrument can be partially within the scope of \nIFRS 9 and partially within the scope of IFRS 15. In such a case, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group first applies \nIFRS 9 for the separation and measurement of the contractual components within the scope of IFRS 9 and only then \napplies IFRS 15 to the remaining contractual components. For instance, administrative fees agreed in a loan agreement \nthat are not an integral part of the effective interest of a financial instrument are taken into account in the commission \nsurplus. \n"}

From today’s perspective, according to \nour estimates, there is a high probability that the ECJ in its decision will affirm the existence of state aid. In addition, \na recovery decision by the EU Commission is necessary in which the Commission has to establish in separate aid \nproceedings that the aid is not reconcilable in the Single Market and thus is also materially unlawful. This too is \nassessed as probable. The recovery amount is based on a best-possible estimate. The resulting provision is EUR 11.4 \nmillion. The endowment of the provision is included in the “result from other operating costs/income”. \nThe operational expenses (including repairs and maintenance cost) for real estate held as a financial investment with \nwhich rental income was generated amounted to EUR 5.7 million (2023: EUR 6.2 million). \nCompanies valued at equity \nThe impairment test carried out in the reporting year for Erste Bank Croatia, a company valued at equity, did not result \nin any change in value (2023: impairment reversal in the amount of EUR 0.4 million). Furthermore, no change in value \nresulted from the impairment test for Erste Bank Serbia, a company valued at equity (2023: impairment reversal in the \namount of EUR 2.4 million). The impairment test for Banka Sparkasse Slovenia, a company valued at equity, resulted \nin an impairment of EUR 9.6 million (2023: impairment reversal in the amount of EUR 1.2 million). The corresponding \nvaluation results are indicated in the result from other operating costs/income. Please see note 54 for further \ninformation. \n"}

Income tax \nCurrent and deferred taxes are fundamentally recorded in the respective period as income or expenses with an impact \non profit or loss. However, taxes that relate to items that are recorded via the “Other comprehensive income” or \ndirectly in the equity are correspondingly also recognised in “Other comprehensive income” or directly in the equity \nand not in the income statement. \nPILLAR 2 \nIn December 2022 the EU-wide minimum taxation system Pillar 2 was adopted as an EU directive and is also relevant \nfor the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group as an internationally active sub-group of the Erste Group. As of 31 December \n2024, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group applies the exception, which is temporarily compulsory, according to IAS \n12 from the balance sheet accounting of deferred taxes resulting from the introduction of the global minimum taxation.  \nSteiermärkische Sparkasse as a parent company in partial ownership is subject to the primary supplementary tax \npursuant to Section 9 Para. 1 of the MinBestG. Pursuant to Section 76 Para. 2 Clause 2 MinBestG, the Erste Group as \nthe highest parent company has the statutory obligation to pay the entire minimum tax to the tax office. With the \ncontract dated 03.06.2024, the invoicing of the supplementary tax paid by the Erste Group for Steiermärkische \nSparkasse was decided upon.  \nThe supplementary tax to be paid by the Erste Group is calculated from the difference between the minimum tax rate \nof 15% defined pursuant to the GloBE and the effective tax rate per tax jurisdiction. The Steiermärkische Sparkasse \nGroup is active in the following tax jurisdictions: Austria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, North Macedonia, Serbia and \nSlovenia. The effective tax burden is over 15% in all tax jurisdictions, with the exception of the tax jurisdictions Bosnia-\nHerzegovina, North Macedonia and Serbia.  \nThrough the introduction of the Minimum Global Tax Law in North Macedonia including a Qualified Domestic Minimum \nTop-Up Tax (QDMTT), the obligation to pay a primary supplementary tax for North Macedonia no longer applies in \nAustria.

Pursuant to IFRS 9, all financial assets and liabilities which also include financial \ninstruments are to be recognised in the statement of financial position and valued depending on the category assigned \nto them. \nPurchases or sales of a financial asset that are usual on the market are recorded on the fulfilment reference date. The \nsettlement date is the date at which a financial asset is transferred. \nThe two following valuation methods are fundamentally available for the valuation of financial instruments: amortised \ncosts and fair value. \ni. Amortised costs and effective rate of interest \nAmortised costs are the amount with which the financial asset or the financial liability is rated during first-time \nrecognition, less the repayments, plus or less the cumulative amortisation of any difference between the original \namount and the amount repayable on the due date, using the effective interest method and in the case of financial \nassets after consideration of any loss allowance. \nThe effective interest rate (EIR) is the interest rate with which the estimated future incoming/outgoing payments are \ndiscounted over the expected term of the financial asset or the financial liability exactly to the gross carrying amount \nof a financial asset (i.e. the amortised costs before consideration of loss allowances) or to the amortised costs of a \nfinancial liability. In the process, the estimated cashflows consider all contractual conditions of the financial instrument; \nhowever, expected credit losses are not taken into consideration. The calculation also incorporates transaction costs \nand processing fees if these are an integral part of the EIR and all other premiums and discounts on the nominal \namount. \nii. Fair value \nDetails on methods that are applied for the fair value measurement and on the fair value hierarchy are shown in Note \n23 Fair value of financial instruments. \nClassification and subsequent measurement of financial assets  \nThe classification and subsequent measurement of financial assets under IFRS 9 is dependent on the two following \ncriteria: \n the business model for the control of financial assets; and \n the characteristics of the contractual cashflow of the financial asset.  \n \nFurther details are shown in this chapter under “Material discretionary decisions, assumptions and estimates”. \nThe application of these criteria leads to the classification of financial assets in three valuation categories that are \ndescribed in the respective note. \n Financial assets valued at amortised cost (AC) \n Financial assets measured at fair value without impact on profit or loss (FVOCI instruments) \n Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) \nClassification and subsequent measurement of financial liabilities \nWith the exception of the financial liabilities rated at the fair value through profit or loss, financial liabilities are valued \nat amortised costs. Interest expenses are calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of a \nfinancial liability. For further details on financial liabilities, we refer to Note 18 Financial liabilities valued at amortised \ncosts. \nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS – FUNDAMENTAL \nACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 60, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n59\nImpairments of financial instruments \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group records impairments in its financial assets from debt instruments that are not \nvalued at the FVPL, its leasing receivables and its off-balance-sheet credit risks from financial guarantees and certain \ncredit commitments. \nThe expected credit loss (ECL) is recognised as an impairment. For the measurement of the amount of the expected \ncredit losses and the recording of interest income, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group differentiates the impairment \nstages: \nStage 1 relates to financial instruments, for which no significant increase in credit risk has been identified since initial \nrecognition. The impairment is calculated in the amount of the share of the credit losses expected over the overall \nterm that result from possible defaults during the next 12 months. Interest income is recorded applying the EIR to the \ngross carrying amount of the financial asset. \nFinancial instruments in Stage 2 indicate a significant increase in the default risk since the initial recognition. The \nimpairment is calculated at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses. Interest income is recorded applying \nthe EIR to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset (as in Stage 1). When committed credit facilities are used \nby customers that have not defaulted, the entire (statement of financial position and off-balance-sheet) credit risk \nvolume is classified as Stage 1 or Stage 2, depending on the development of the credit risk between commitment and \nfirst-time use. \nFinancial instruments in Stage 3 have an impaired credit rating. Here, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group has \nchosen the approach to align the IFRS 9 definition of the “impaired credit rating” to the default definition under \nsupervisory law pursuant to the specifications of the European Banking Authority in EBA/GL/2016/07 and the \nDelegated Regulation (EU) 2018/171 of the Commission. When the definition of default is used, there is generally an \noverall customer perspective at the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group that results in an assignment to Stage 3 with \nall transactions with a customer, also if the default is only done in one of several transactions (pulling effect). However, \nan upgrade of the default status brings about a loss of the impaired credit standing in all risk positions with the \ncustomer. The impairment of the financial instruments in Stage 3 is calculated at an amount equal to the lifetime \nexpected credit losses. Interest income is calculated applying the effective interest rate to the amortised costs of the \nfinancial asset (i.e. the net carrying value). From a statement of financial position perspective, interest deferrals and \naccruals are recorded on the basis of the gross carrying amount of the financial asset. The difference between the \naccrued or deferred interest income is compensated by the statement of financial position loss allowance account \n(without influencing the impairment in the income statement). \nFor purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets (POCI), lifetime expected credit losses are initially included \nin the credit-adjusted effective interest rate. Therefore, no loss allowance will be formed at the beginning. \nSubsequently, only disadvantageous changes of the credit losses expected over the term are taken into consideration \nafter the first-time recording as an impairment, whereas positive changes are recorded as impairment income that \nincrease the gross carrying value of the POCI assets. No impairment stages are differentiated for POCI assets. \nThe valuation of the expected credit losses includes cashflows that are expected from collateral and the financial \nguarantees held by the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group that are seen as an integral contractual component of the \nfinancial assets whose risk is guaranteed. The Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group views guarantees as integral when \nthey are concluded as of or close to the start of the guaranteed financial assets. If the bank is granted the option of \nrequiring a guarantee in a loan agreement, this guarantee is also considered integral. Bonuses that are paid for an \nintegral financial guarantee and other loan collateral are included in the effective interest rate of the underlying \nfinancial asset. \nMore detailed information on the identification of significant increases in credit risk (including assessment on a \ncollective basis), on estimation methods for the calculation of 12-month ECL and lifetime expected credit losses, and \non the definition of default is presented in the “Credit risk” section of note 31. Reviewing and monitoring of the credit \nrisk shown Information on the definition of default are included in Note 34 Calculation of the expected credit loss. \n"}

In the case of financial assets measured at FVOCI, however, the impairment is recognised in \nthe accumulated other result. This recording is done in the statement on changes in equity as a “fair value reserve”. \nThe impairments for credit commitments and financial guarantees are shown in the statement of financial position \n\"Provisions\". \nInformation on the development of the expected loan losses of the respective financial instruments are included in \nNote 34 Measurement of the expected credit loss.  \nIn the income statement, impairment expenses and income for all types of financial instruments are shown in the \nposition \"Result from impairments of financial instruments\". \nDerecognition of financial instruments and treatment of contractual modifications \ni. Derecognition of financial assets \nIn the income statement, the difference between the carrying amount of the derecognised financial asset and the \nconsideration received is shown in the line \"Gains/Losses from the derecognition of financial assets at amortised \ncosts\" or, in the case of financial assets at the FVOCI in the line \"Other gains/losses from the derecognition of financial \ninstruments measured at fair value without impact on profit or loss. For financial assets at the FVPL, the gains or losses \nfrom the derecognition together with the valuation results are recorded in the line \"Trading result\" or \"Gains/Losses \nfrom financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss\". \nii. Derecognition criteria for contractual modifications of financial assets \nWithin the framework of the ongoing credit business and in agreement with the respective debtors, it may be the case \nthat the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group re-negotiates certain conditions of the underlying contracts or amends \nthem in another way. This can include, for instance, market-driven commercial re-negotiations or contractual \namendments that aim to mitigate or prevent financial difficulties of the borrower. For the assessment of the economic \nassets and the financial effects of such contractual modifications, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group has \ndeveloped a number of criteria based on which it is determined whether the amended criteria fundamentally differ \nfrom the original ones and therefore the financial asset needs to be derecognised. \nMarket-based interest adjustments that meet specific conditions do not trigger any assessment of the significance of \nthe change: Instead, they result in a new calculation of the EIR of the loans. Such interest adjustments usually do not \nrefer to non-performing loans that do not have any forbearance status and for which an early payment option and a \nsufficiently competitive refinancing market exist. In addition, the costs that are incurred by the debtor in the case of \nadvance payment or early termination must be assessed as low. Such conditions introduce an implicit, variable interest \nelement in the contract. This type of interest adjustments is rarely used for loans in Stage 2. \nFundamental amendments result in the derecognition of the original financial asset and the first-time recognition of \nthe modified financial asset as a new financial instrument. The following events are covered by this regulation: \n change of contractual counterparty (unless a formal change, e.g. change of legal designation); \n change of contract currency (unless the change results from the exercise of an option to change currency contained \nin the original contract with pre-defined conditions or the new currency is pegged to the original currency); \nintroduction of contractual clauses that do not meet the SPPI criterion (unless concessions that improve the \ncollectibility of receivables by allowing obligors to recover from financial difficulties); or \n removal of a contractual clause that does not meet the SPPI criterion. \n the removal of a contractual clause that is not compliant with SPPI \nFor certain derecognition criteria, it is decisive whether the contractual modification was carried out at a debtor with \nfinancial difficulties. Certain contractual modifications at debtors with financial difficulties are not seen as fundamental \nas they aim to improve the prospects of the bank regarding the retrievability of the receivables by the repayment plans \nbeing adapted to the specific financial prerequisites of these debtors. However, if such contractual modifications are \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 62, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n61\napplied to debtors who are not non-performing, these can be seen as fundamental enough in order to trigger a \nderecognition. This is explained in more detail below. \nThe following criteria lead to derecognition unless they are deemed to be forbearance methods, they are applied to \ndefaulted customers or they trigger a default (i.e. the derecognition is based on a modification that does not result \nfrom financial difficulties of the customer): \n change in the repayment schedule that results in the weighted remaining term of the asset changing by more than \n100% and not less than two years compared to the original asset;  \n change in the timing/amount of contractual cash flows that results in the present value of the modified cash flows \n(discounted by the effective interest rate before modification) deviating by more than 10% from the gross carrying \namount of the asset directly before the change (cumulative assessment taking all changes in the last twelve months \ninto account); or \n conversion of a variable interest rate into a fixed interest rate or conversely for the entire residual term of the financial \nasset. \nIf contractual modifications that are deemed to be forbearance measures or that are applied to defaulted customers \nor that trigger a default (i.e. they result from financial difficulties of the customer) are so fundamental that they are \nseen qualitatively as repayment of the original contract, they result in derecognition. Examples of such modifications \nare: \n a new agreement with fundamentally amended contractual components that was signed within the framework of a \nrestructuring that has become necessary after a standstill agreement that suspends the rights of the original assets \ntemporarily; \n merger of several original loans into one asset with fundamentally amended conditions; or \n conversion of a revolving loan into a non-revolving loan. \nContractual modifications that lead to a derecognition of the respective original asset lead to the first-time recognition \nof a new financial asset. If the debtor has defaulted or the fundamental modification leads to the default, the new \nasset will be treated as a POCI. The difference between the carrying amount of the derecognised asset and the fair \nvalue of the new POCI asset with first-time recognition is indicated in the income statement in the line \"Result from \nimpairments of financial instruments\". \nIf the obligor is not in default or the material modification does not result in default, the new asset recognised after \nderecognition of the original asset is allocated to Stage 1. For loans at amortised cost, the non-amortised amount of \nthe origination fees/transaction costs, which is accounted for in the effective interest rate, is included in “Net interest \nincome” as at the date of derecognition. The reversal of impairments that were formed for the original asset at the \ntime of the fundamental modification and the formation of the impairment for the new asset are indicated in the line \n\"Result from impairments of financial instruments\". The remaining difference is shown in the line \"Gains/Losses from \nthe derecognition of financial assets valued at amortised costs\". \nFor debt instruments not measured at FVPL and subject to contractual modifications that do not result in derecognition, \nthe gross carrying amount of the asset is adjusted by the recognition of a modification gain or loss. This modification \ngain or loss equals the difference between the gross carrying amount before modification and the present value of \nthe cash flows of the modified asset, discounted by the original effective interest rate. In the income statement, the \nmodification gain or loss is shown in the line \"Interest income\" under \"interest surplus\" when the modifications refer \nto financial assets in Stage 1. For financial assets in Stage 2 and 3 and POCI assets, the modification gain or loss is \nreported in “Net income from impairment on financial instruments”. However, if the contractual modification entails \nthe bank surrendering its rights to cash flows in connection with the outstanding amount of the asset, such as (partial) \nwaiver of the principal or accrued interest, this waiver is treated as a write-down. \niii. Depreciation \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group writes down a financial asset or part thereof when it has no realistic \nexpectations of receiving the respective cash flows from the asset. With such a depreciation, the gross carrying \namount of the asset and the respective status of impairments are reduced in equal measure. \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 63, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n62\nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group has determined criteria for the write-down of irretrievable receivables in the \ncredit business. Write-downs can result from forbearance measures in which the bank contractually waives a part of \nthe outstanding amount in order to help the customer in overcoming financial difficulties and thus to improve the \nprospects of the retrievability of the remaining credit (in the case of corporate customers normally assuming a going \nconcern). Information on forbearance is included in Note 36 Restructurings, renegotiations and forbearance.  \nIn scenarios without a going concern, write-downs of irretrievable receivables from corporate customers through legal \nenforcement measures such as bankruptcy, liquidation or court proceedings. Other triggers for write-downs can result \nfrom decisions to waive enforcement due to the worthlessness of the receivable or collateral, or generally from the \nassessment that the receivable is economically lost. For retail customers, the uncollectibility and the timing and \namount of the write-down are revealed in the course of the collection process when it becomes apparent that the \namount due cannot be collected, for example as a result of ongoing insolvency proceedings. Other irretrievable \nreceivables are written off after the collection process. \niv. Derecognition of financial liabilities \nIn the income statement, the difference between the carrying amount of the derecognised financial liability and the \npaid consideration depending on the derecognised financial liability is indicated in the line \"Other gains/losses from \nthe derecognition of financial instruments measured at fair value without impact on profit or loss\", \"Gains/losses from \nfinancial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss\" or \"Trading result\". \nFundamental discretionary decisions, assumptions and estimates \ni. SPPI assessment \nThe assessment of whether contractual cash flows from financial assets are solely payments of principal and interest \n(SPPI) is subject to significant judgements on the basis of IFRS 9. This judgement is critical to the IFRS 9 classification \nand measurement process, as it determines whether the asset is to be measured at FVPL or, depending on the \nassessment of the business model, at amortised cost or FVOCI. Taking into account the contractual characteristics of \nloans in the business of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group, discretionary decisions are taken primarily in the \nfollowing areas: Compensation for early repayment, project financing and benchmark tests for loans that are endowed \nwith incongruent interest components. \nThe assessment whether compensation for early repayment that is applied to loans constituted an appropriate \ncompensation for early termination or advance payment is based on a comparison of the amount of the fees with the \neconomic costs that have been incurred by the bank as a result of the early termination or advance payment. For this \npurpose, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group uses a quantitative test, in which these costs are calculated from the \nloss of the interest margin and the interest loss resulting from a potential reduction in the interest rate level before the \nadvance payment. The appropriateness of the fees can also be presented on a qualitative basis, such as on the basis \nof common market practice regarding the size of prepayment penalties and their acceptance by authorities. \nWith project financing, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group checks whether it involves an elementary loan \nagreement and not an investment in the financed projects. In this context, credit rating, degree of collateralisation, \nexisting guarantees of the sponsors and the equity endowment of the financed projects are taken into account. \nIncongruent interest components refer to variable-interest financial assets for which: - the term of the reference \ninterest rate (e.g. EURIBOR) deviates from the frequency of the fixed-interest term (\"tenor mismatch\"), -  time delays \noccur when the interest rate is fixed before the start of the interest period, or such characteristics are combined. In \norder to subject such incongruent interest components to an SPPI assessment, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group, \nhas developed a so-called benchmark test. This test checks whether the mismatched interest components could \nresult in (undiscounted) contractual cash flows that differ considerably from a benchmark deal which does not indicate \nsuch mismatches. For assets with interest rate mismatches resulting only from time-delayed interest rates (i.e. without \ntenor mismatches), the SPPI criterion is deemed fulfilled based on a qualitative assessment if the time between the \nfixing of the interest rate and the beginning of the interest period is not more than one month. \n"}

Subsequently, the issuing of new loans with interest \nincongruencies was largely restricted so that a quantitative benchmark test is only applied in exceptional cases. \nii. Assessment of the business model \nWith each financial asset that is compliant with SPPI, it needs to be assessed during first-time recognition whether \nthis is held in a business model whose goal is only to collect the contractual cashflows (business model \"hold\") or in \nthe collection of the contractual cashflows and the sale of the assets (business model \"hold and sell\") or whether this \nis held in another business model. The decisive aspect for making the distinction is therefore the frequency and \nmateriality of sales of assets in the respective business model. As an asset is allocated to a business model on initial \nrecognition, it is possible that cash flows in subsequent periods are realised differently than originally expected, so \nthat a different measurement method appears appropriate. Pursuant to IFRS 9, such retrospective changes to existing \nfinancial assets usually do not lead to reclassifications or error corrections in previous periods. However, the new \ninformation on how cash flows are realised can indicate that the business model and thus the measurement method \nfor newly acquired or newly originated financial assets has changed. \nAt the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group, certain sales and other derecognitions are not seen as being in conflict with \na business model with the goal of collecting contractual cashflows. Examples are sales due to an increase in the \ndefault risk, sales that take place close to the due date of the asset, as well as rare sales due to non-recurring events \n(such as changes in the regulatory or fiscal environment, major internal restructurings or company mergers or a serious \nliquidity crisis) or a derecognition that results from an offer by the issuer to exchange a bond. Other types of sales \nthat are carried out in the business model \"Hold\" are assessed retrospectively. If certain quantitative threshold values \nare exceeded during this process or if this is seen as necessary with regard to new expectation, the Steiermärkische \nSparkasse Group will also conduct a prospective test. If the carrying amount of assets that are expected to be sold \nfrom the current business model over their expected useful life for reasons other than those named above exceeds \n10% of the carrying amount of the portfolio, new acquisitions or originations of assets must be allocated to a different \nbusiness model. \niii. Impairments of financial instruments \nThe impairment model of expected credit losses per se is based on discretionary decisions as it requires an \nassessment whether a significant increase in the default risk exists, without providing detailed guidelines on this. With \nregard to the significant increase in the default risk, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group has stipulated specific \nassessment criteria that consist of qualitative information and quantitative threshold values. Another complex area is \nthe formation of groups of similar assets, which is necessary in order to assess the increase of credit risk on a \ncollective basis before specific information is available at the level of individual instruments. The calculation of the \nexpected credit losses incorporates complex models that are based on historical statistics on default probabilities and \ndefault loss ratios, their extrapolations in the case of insufficient observations, individual estimates of the credit \nstanding-adapted cashflows and probabilities of various scenarios, including consideration of future-oriented \ninformation. In addition, the actually expected term of the instruments must be modelled with regard to revolving credit \nfacilities. \nMore detailed information on the identification of significant increases in credit risk (including assessment on a \ncollective basis), on estimation methods for the calculation of 12-month ECL and lifetime expected credit losses, and \non the definition of default is presented in the “Credit risk” section of note 31. Reviewing and monitoring of the credit \nrisk shown Information on the definition of default are included in Note 34 Calculation of the expected credit loss. The \ndevelopment of the risk provisions is described in Note 36 Development of the loss allowances for credit risks. \n \n \n"}

Financial assets measured at fair value without impact on profit or loss – Debt \ninstruments \nDebt instruments are recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value through other comprehensive \nincome (FVOCI) if its contractual cashflows are compliant with SPPI and they are held within a business model whose \ngoals are both the collection of contractual cashflows as well as the sale of assets (business model \"Hold and sell\"). \nIn the statement of financial position, they are included as “Debt instruments” under “Financial assets at fair value \nthrough other comprehensive income”. \nInterest income from these assets is calculated according to the effective interest method and indicated in the income \nstatement in the line \"Interest income\" under \"Interest surplus\". impairment income and expenses are included in the \nline \"Result from impairments of financial instruments\". The corresponding charge is recognised in OCI and not against \nthe carrying amount of the asset. The valuation effect in the income statement is thus the same as with financial \nassets valued at amortised costs. \nThe difference between the fair value at which the assets are indicated in the statement of financial position and the \namortised costs is shown in the statement of changes in equity in the item \"Fair value reserve\" as a cumulative other \nresult (other comprehensive income, \"OCI\"). The changes in the reporting period are posted in the other result in the \nline \"Fair value reserve of debt instruments\".. This line also contains the corresponding charge for impairment gains \nor losses. On derecognition of the financial asset, the amount previously accumulated in other comprehensive income \nis reclassified to the income statement in “Other gains/losses arising from the derecognition of financial instruments \nnot measured at fair value through profit or loss”. \nAt the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group, the FVOCI category investments in bonds, i.e. credit business, is not included \nin this valuation category. Similarly to the bonds valued at amortised costs, these refer to various business goals such \nas fulfilment of internal/external liquidity risk requirements and efficient placement of the structural liquidity surplus, \nstrategic positions decided upon by the Management Board, initiation and promotion of customer relationships, \nreplacement for credit transactions or other activities to increase income. The common feature of these debt \ninstruments in the FVOCI category is that an active optimisation of income via sales makes a fundamental contribution \nto reaching the goals of this business model. The sales are made in order to optimise the liquidity situation or to \ngenerate gains and losses from changes in fair value. The business goals are accordingly achieved through the \ncollection of contractual cashflows and through sales of the debt instruments. \nGross carrying amounts and loss allowances per impairment stage \n \nGross carrying amounts \nLoss allowances for credit risks \n  \n  \n  \nin EUR million \nLevel 1 \nLevel 2 \nLevel 3 \nTotal \nStage 1 \nStage 2 \nStage 3 \nTotal \nAmortise\nd costs \nCumulated \nchanges in \nthe other \nresult \nFair \nvalue \n2024 \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nCentral banks \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \nGovernments \n272.6 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n272.6 \n-0.1 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n-0.1 \n272.5 \n-3.7 \n268.8 \nBanks \n1.5 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n1.5 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n1.5 \n0.0 \n1.5 \nOther financial \ninstitutions \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \nNon-financial \ncompanies \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \nTotal \n274.1 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n274.1 \n-0.1 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n-0.1 \n274.0 \n-3.7 \n270.3 \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n2023 \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nCentral banks \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \nGovernments \n219.4 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n219.4 \n-0.1 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n-0.1 \n219.3 \n-8.7 \n210.7 \nBanks \n1.5 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n1.5 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n1.5 \n0.0 \n1.5 \nOther financial \ninstitutions \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \nNon-financial \ncompanies \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \nTotal \n221.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n221.0 \n-0.1 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n-0.1 \n220.9 \n-8.7 \n212.2 \n \nFINANCIAL ASSETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE \nWITHOUT IMPACT ON PROFIT OR LOSS \n"}

Financial assets measured at fair value without impact on profit or loss – Equity \ninstruments \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group utilises the option to measure certain investments in equity instruments not \nheld for trading at FVOCI. This right to choose is applied for participations that constitute strategically important \nbusiness relationships in the banking sector (with the exception of the insurance business). The gains or losses from \nfair value changes for the reporting period are indicated as other result in the line \"Fair value reserve of equity \ninstruments\" in the consolidated statements of recognised income and expenses. The cumulative gains or losses are \nindicated in the statement of changes in equity in the item \"Fair value reserve\". This amount recognised in OCI is never \nreclassified to the income statement. However, when such equity instruments are derecognised at FVOCI, the amount \naccumulated in OCI is reclassified to retained earnings. Dividends received from instruments of this category are \nindicated in the income statement in the line \"Dividend income\". In the statement of financial position, financial assets \nat fair value through other comprehensive income are reported as “Equity instruments” under “Financial assets at fair \nvalue through other comprehensive income”. \nAs at 31 December 2024, the carrying value of the equity instruments FVOCI of the Group amounted to EUR 215.8 \nmillion (2023: EUR 133.7 million); the cumulative fair value change for equity instruments FVOCI before taxes recorded \nin the other result was EUR 166.5 million (2023: EUR 84.4 million).  \nIn 2024, no equity instruments were sold at FVOCI and there was thus no reclassification of the cumulative other \nresult in the retained earnings from this circumstance. In 2023, 501,002 shares in Erste Group Bank AG were sold \nwith a carrying amount of EUR 13.9 million. The cumulative profit (after taxes) that was transferred during the \nderecognition of the cumulative other result to the profit reserve amounted to EUR 1.1 million.  \n \n \n"}

In most cases, it is expected of these financial \nassets that they are sold before they become due, or that the development of the portfolio in which they are contained \nis assessed on the basis of the fair value. In the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group, such business models are typical \nof assets that are held for trading purposes (i.e. financial assets that are held by the trading departments of the bank) \nor of assets whose value is predominantly realised by sales (e.g. credit syndications that have not yet been completed \nwhen the loan is offered for sale on the market. Furthermore, financial assets held by fully consolidated investment \nfunds are measured at FVPL as they are managed and measured on a fair value basis. \nOther cases of FVPL valuations relate to financial assets whose contractual cashflows do not correspond to the SPPI \ncriterion. In the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group, certain debt instruments and loans to customers are affected by \nthis. \nIn the statement of financial position, held debt instruments measured at FVPL are shown as “Non-trading financial \nassets measured at fair value with impact on profit or loss” under the sub-items “Debt instruments” and “Loans and \nadvances to customers”. Financial assets are indicated as \"mandatory for the FvPL\" when they are assigned to another \nbusiness model (not \"Hold\" or \"Hold and sell\") and they are  not held for trading purposes or their contractual \ncashflows are not compliant with SPPI.  \nInvestments in equity instruments not held for trading are likewise measured at FVPL, unless they are designated as \nat FVOCI. In the statement of financial position, such instruments are reported as “Non-trading financial assets at fair \nvalue through profit or loss” in the sub-item “Equity instruments” or in the sub-category “Mandatorily measured at \nFVPL” in note 22. \nPursuant to IFRS 9, all derivative financial instruments, if they are not designated as a collateral instrument, are \nclassified as held for trading purposes and rated at fair value through profit or loss. For further statements, we refer \nto Note 21 “Derivatives”. \nIn the income statement, gains and losses from non-derivative financial assets measured at FVPL are divided into \ninterest and dividend income and gains and losses from changes in fair value. Interest income from debt instruments \nis shown in the line \"Other similar income\" under \"Interest surplus\" and calculated using the EIR on the amortised \ncosts of the financial asset. Dividend income from equity instruments are shown in the line \"Dividend income\". The \ngains and losses from fair value changes are calculated after deduction of the interest or dividend income and include \ntransaction costs and processing fees. They are shown in the line \"Trading result\" for financial assets held for trading \npurposes and in the line \"Gains/losses from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss, in the \ncase of financial assets not held for trading purposes. For units in unconsolidated funds, the interest or dividend \ncomponent is not separated from the gains and losses from changes in fair value. \n \n \nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE \nWITH IMPACT ON PROFIT OR LOSS \n"}

Derivatives  \nTo manage interest, currency and other market price risks, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group uses derivative \nfinancial instruments. Here, primarily interest rate swaps, interest rate options, currency swaps and currency options \nare used. \nFor presentation purposes, the following derivatives are differentiated: \n Derivatives – held for trading \n Derivatives – Hedge accounting  \nDerivatives are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at their fair value (dirty price). Positive fair \nvalues of derivatives are indicated in the statement of financial position as assets, negative fair values as liabilities. \nDerivatives held for trading are derivatives not designated as a hedging instrument (hedge accounting). These are \nindicated irrespective of their internal classification, i.e. both derivatives of the trading book and derivatives of the \nnon-trading book, in the item \"Derivatives\". \n“Derivatives – hedge accounting” are derivatives designated as a hedging instrument that meet the conditions of IAS \n39 (see hedge accounting). These are shown on the assets and liabilities side in the statement of financial position in \nthe item \"Derivatives – Hedge accounting\". \nChanges in the fair value (clean price) of derivatives held for trading purposes are shown in the income statement in \nthe \"Trading result\". Interest income/expenses of derivatives held for trading purposes and of hedging derivatives are \nshown in the income statement in the item \"Other similar income\" or \"Other similar expenses\" under \"Interest surplus\". \nThese interest income/expenses are recognised on the basis of accrual similar to the effective interest rate with regard \nto the nominal value of the derivative, including the amortisation of the initial value (e.g. any advance fees). \nEmbedded derivatives \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group issues certain financial liabilities that have structured features. “Structured \nfeatures” means that a derivative is embedded in a non-derivative host instrument. \nEmbedded derivatives that are separated are recognised in the statement of financial position as a stand-alone \nderivative and indicated in the statement of financial position in the item “Derivatives”.  \nDerivatives – held for trading \nin EUR million \nNominal value \nFair value \nNominal value \nFair value \n \nTotal \n  \n  \nTotal \n  \n  \n \n2024 \nPositive \nNegative \n2023 \nPositive \nNegative \nDerivatives of the non-trading  book \n1,342.2 \n12.0 \n-8.2 \n643.3 \n4.3 \n-9.1 \nInterest rate \n1,131.3 \n8.6 \n-8.1 \n318.1 \n4.0 \n-3.7 \nForeign exchange business \n210.9 \n3.4 \n-0.1 \n325.3 \n0.3 \n-5.4 \nTotal \n1,342.2 \n12.0 \n-8.2 \n643.3 \n4.3 \n-9.1 \n \n"}

Fair value of financial instruments \nThe fair value measurement in the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group is done primarily on the basis of external data \nsources (stock exchange prices or broker listings in highly liquid market segments). Financial instruments whose fair \nvalue is measured on the basis of quoted market prices are mainly listed securities and derivatives, and liquid \nborrowings traded on over-the-counter markets. \nIf the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial position is not derived \nfrom an active market, it is determined using different valuation methods (including the use of mathematical methods). \nThe inputs for these models are derived from observable market data as far as possible. If this is not possible, the fair \nvalue must be determined on the basis of estimates. The use of non-observable parameters is particularly relevant for \nmodels for the valuation of loans and equity instruments not listed on the stock exchange. Valuation models, the fair \nvalue hierarchy and fair values of financial instruments are explained in more detail below.  \nA fair value is determined for all financial instruments on a recurring basis.  \nFinancial instruments recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value \nDescription of the valuation models and parameters \nFor the determination of the fair value of financial instruments, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group uses valuation \nmodels that have gone through an internal auditing process and for which the independent determination of the \nvaluation parameters (such as interest rates, exchange rates, volatilities and credit spreads) is ensured.  \nLoans  \nThe calculation method for the determination of the fair value of loans that do not meet the SPPI “solely payments of \nprincipal and interest”) criterion corresponds to the simple present value method according to the fair value definition. \nThe loan risk is taken into account in that the contractually agreed cash flows are adapted with the inclusion of the \nprobability of default (PD) and the Loss Given Default (LGD) in the expected cash flows. The discounting of the \nadjusted cash flows is done with an interest curve which comprises the risk-free interest rate and a refinancing \nsupplement for priority non-collateralised issues. \nDebt instruments \nFor plain vanilla debt securities (fixed and variable), the fair value is calculated by discounting future cash flows. The \ndiscounting curve is dependent on the interest rate of the issue currency and a spread adjustment derived from the \nissuer’s credit spread curve. If there is no issuer curve, the spread is derived from a similar instrument and adjusted \nfor differences in the risk profile of the instrument. If no similar financial instrument is available, the spread is adjusted \nbased on other information, e.g. credit spread calculation based on internal ratings and probabilities of default or on \nthe basis of management decisions. In the case of more complex debt instruments (such as instruments with optional \ncharacteristics such as termination rights, interest upper and lower thresholds or index dependencies), the fair value \nis determined using a combination of discounted payment streams and more complex actuarial models like those that \nare also applied in the calculation method for OTC derivatives.  \nEquity instruments \nFor equity instruments not held for trading (participating interests) that do not have listed market prices on an active \nmarket, the fair value is determined through standard valuation methods using non-observable input parameters. \nThese include the adjusted net inventory method, the simplified capitalised earnings method, the dividend discount \nmodel and the multiplier method.  \nWith the adjusted net inventory value method, the fair value of the assets and liabilities recorded in the statement of \nfinancial position of a company, as well as the fair value of assets and liabilities not recognised in the statement of \nfinancial position is determined as of the valuation reference date. The resulting fair values of the assets and liabilities \nrecognised and not recognised in the statement of financial position therefore constitute the fair value of the equity \nof the associate company.  \nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS – OTHER INFORMATION \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 76, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n75\nWith the dividend discount model, it is assumed that the value of an equity instrument that is issued by a company \ncorresponds to the present value of a perpetual dividend. The fair value is also calculated on the basis of discounted \nfuture income under the simplified income method. However, this method can also be used when only one income \nplanned for a year is available. The simplified earnings value method and the dividend discount model discount future \nincome and dividends, using a discounting interest rate that reflects the equity costs. The cost of equity is dependent \non the risk-free interest rate, the market risk premium, the levered beta and the country risk premium. Levered beta is \nderived from the industry classification, which is published and managed by Prof. Damodaran.  \nIn rare cases, the multiplier method is used. This approach uses exchange rates and other relevant information from \nmarket transactions with comparable companies of an associate company to derive a multiplier. With the aid of this \nmultiplier, the fair value of the participation value or goodwill is determined.  \nOTC derivatives \nDerivatives that are traded on liquid markets (e.g. interest rate swaps and options, foreign currency transactions and \noptions, options on listed securities or indices, credit default swaps and commodity swaps) are measured according \nto standard measurement models. These models incorporate discounted cashflow models, option models according \nto Black-Scholes and Hull-White as well as hazard rate models. The models are calibrated on listed market data \n(including implicit volatilities). Monte Carlo simulations are also used for the valuation of more complex instruments. \nFor instruments in insufficiently liquid markets, market data from irregular transactions are used or extrapolation \ntechniques used. For the determination of the fair value of derivatives secured in euros, a discount interest rate is used \nthat reflects the interest rate fundamental for the interest of the cash collateral.  \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group values derivatives pursuant to the mid-market rate. In order to account for the \nlevel of the bid-ask spread of relevant items, an adjustment is made on the basis of market liquidity. The adjustment \nparameters depend on type of product, currency, duration and volume. The parameters are reviewed regularly and in \nthe event of significant market movements.  \nAs part of the measurement of OTC derivatives, measurement adjustments are made for counterparty default risk \n(credit loss allowance (CVA)) and adjustments are made for own credit risk (debit loss allowance (DVA)). With the CVA, \nthe adjustment is oriented to the expected positive risk of the derivative and the default probability of the counterparty. \nThe DVA is determined by the expected negative exposure of the derivative and the default probability of the Erste \nGroup. The modelling of the expected exposure is based on option replication strategies or Monte Carlo simulation \ntechniques. \nThe described methodology leads to CVA loss allowances in the amount of EUR -1.0 million (2023: EUR -1.0 million) \nand to DVA loss allowances in the total amount of EUR 0.2 million (2023: EUR 0.0 million). \nBased on an analysis carried out, it was decided that no funding loss allowance (FVA) will be considered for the \nvaluation of OTC derivatives. \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 77, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n76\nValidation and control \nThe responsibility for the measurement of financial instruments at fair value is independent of the trading units. The \nvaluation of financial instruments is done on the basis of a service level agreement in the Erste Group, where an \nindependent validation department has been set up in order to ensure the functional separation between units for the \nmodel development, valuation price determination and validation. The aim of independent model validation is to \nmeasure model risks, which arise from the theoretical basis of the model, the quality of the input data (such as market \ndata) and model calibration. \nFair value hierarchy \nThe fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are assigned to the three categories of the IFRS fair value \nhierarchy. \nLevel 1 of the fair value hierarchy \nDerivatives traded on the stock exchange (options), shares, sovereign bonds and other bonds as well as funds that \nare traded in liquid and active markets are assigned to this category. \nLevel 2 of the fair value hierarchy \nIf a market valuation is used whose market value cannot be seen as an active market due to reduced liquidity (derived \nfrom available market liquidity indicators), the underlying financial instrument is classified as Level 2. If no market \nprices are available, measurement will be done based on models drawn from market data. If all fundamental \nparameters of the valuation model are observable on the market, the financial instrument is classified as Level 2 of \nthe fair value hierarchy. For Level 2 valuations, typically interest curves, credit spreads and implicit volatilities are used \nas transparent, observable market parameters.  \nBesides OTC derivatives, this category primarily includes less liquid stocks, bonds and funds and own issues. \nLevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy \nAs soon as a parameter which is not observable on the market becomes significant for the measurement model or the \nmarket price is not regularly observable, the financial instrument is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. \nTypically, credit spreads that are derived from internal estimates for default probabilities (probability of default, PD) \nand loss ratios (loss given default, LGD) are used as non-observable parameters. \nThe volume of financial instruments that are assigned to the Level 3 category can be divided into the following areas: \n market values of derivatives for which the CVA adjustment has a fundamental influence on the valuation and are \ncalculated by means of non-observable parameters (i.e. using internal estimates for PDs and LGDs). \n Illiquid bonds and unlisted shares, shareholdings or funds measured using models that include values not observable \non the market (e.g. credit spreads) or measured using broker quotations that are not attributable to Level 1 or Level \n2. \n loans whose contractual payment streams of the assets do not only constitute payments of nominal and interest. \nThe allocation of the corresponding levels is determined for all positions at the end of the reporting period.  \nFinancial assets are reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2 or 3 or vice versa when the above criteria for their allocation \nto the respective level cease to be met. \n"}

The interest rate effect is based on market interest \nrate movements, while the changes in the credit spread are derived from probabilities of default (PDs) and losses \ngiven default (LGDs), which are used for internal risk calculations. Loans and advances were consolidated in \nhomogeneous portfolios. The classification was based on rating methodology, rating category, maturity and the \ncountry in which they were posted. The fair values of bonds valued at amortised cost are primarily determined either \ndirectly by the market or on the basis of directly observable market parameters (e.g. interest rate curves).  \nThe fair value of deposits and other liabilities that are measured at amortised cost is estimated taking into account the \nactual interest environment and own credit spreads. For liabilities without contractual maturity (e.g. demand deposits), \nthe residual carrying amount is assumed to be the minimum fair value.  \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 83, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n82\nThe fair value of the securities and subordinate liabilities issued, measured at amortised cost is based on the same \nvaluation models, as described above for the liabilities in the section “financial instruments recognised in the statement \nof financial position at fair value”. \nFor off-balance-sheet liabilities (financial guarantees and irrevocable credit commitments) the fair value of irrevocable \ncredit commitments is determined with the aid of regulatory credit conversion factors. The resulting credit equivalents \nare treated as assets recognised in the statement of financial position. The difference between the total fair value and \nthe nominal value of the hypothetical credit risk equivalent corresponds to the fair value of the irrevocable credit \ncommitments. If the total fair value of the hypothetical credit equivalents is higher than the nominal value, the fair \nvalue of irrevocable credit facilities is positive. The fair value of financial guarantees is calculated by analogy to a CDS \nmodel. In accordance with this model, the fair value results from the total of the present values of future cashflows. \nThese include the outgoing payments as the result of the use of the guarantees which are modelled on the basis of \nthe PDs and LGDs of the respective customers, as well as incoming payments from the guarantee fees received in \nfuture. If the present values of the future outgoing payments exceed the present values of the future guarantee fees, \nthe fair value of financial guarantees is negative. \n24.  Hedge accounting \nTo hedge the foreign currency and interest risk, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group uses hedge accounting. As \npermitted by the transitional provisions of IFRS 9, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group opted to continue applying \nthe hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39. \ni. Fair value hedge \nChanges in the fair value (clean price) of derivative financial instruments that are used within the framework of qualified \nand designated fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement in the item “Trading result”. Interest income \nand expenses from hedging derivatives are indicated in the item \"Other similar income\" or \"Other similar costs\" under \n\"Interest surplus\". The fair value change in the underlying transaction that is assigned to the hedged risk is also \nrecorded in the income statement in the item \"Trading result\" and is part of the carrying amount of the underlying \ntransaction. \nFor hedging relationships that have ended, the fair value adjustment of the underlying transaction is triggered over \nthe residual term until the due date and indicated in the income statement in the item \"Interest income\" (when the \nunderlying transaction was a financial asset) or \"Interest costs\" (if the underlying transaction was a financial liability) \nunder \"Interest surplus\". For portfolio fair value hedges of interest change risks, the fair loss allowance of the \nterminated hedging relationship is amortised using the straight-line method and shown in the income statement in the \nitem \"Other similar income\" under \"Interest surplus\". \nii. Cash flow hedge \nCash flow hedges are used to avoid uncertainty in future cash flows and thereby to stabilise net interest income. The \neffective part of the profit or loss of hedging instruments that are used within the framework of designated and \nqualified cashflow hedges is recorded in the other result in the \"cashflow hedge provision\". The ineffective portion is \nreported in the income statement under net trading income. The derivative is analysed at its clean price (i.e. without \nthe interest component) to determine the effective/ineffective portion. If the hedged payment is incorporated into the \nincome statement, the profits and losses from the hedging instrument are transferred from the other result into the \ncorresponding item of the income statement (in most cases into the item \"Other similar income\" or \"Other similar \ncosts\" under \"Interest surplus\"). There is no deviation in the accounting treatment for cash flow hedges compared to \nsituations in which no hedge is applied. \nFor hedging relationships that have ended, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in the \nother result remains in the “cashflow hedge reserve” until the transaction occurs. \nHedging of interest risks  \nThe goals of the market risk management in the bank accounts of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group are the \noptimisation of the risk position taking into account the economic environment and the competition situation and in \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 84, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n83\ncompliance with the market value risk and the effect on the interest surplus as well as observance of an appropriate \nliquidity position for the Group.  \nPursuant to the goals of the risk management, the hedging activities are concentrated on the two main control \nparameters – the interest result on the one hand and the market value risk on the other. To manage these, the following \ninstruments are available: Cashflow hedges are used for measures to stabilise the cashflows. Fair value hedges are \nused for measures to reduce the market value risk.  \nFair value hedges are used to turn fixed-interest or structured transactions into money-market linked transactions. \nPursuant to the interest and hedge strategy, securitised liabilities of non-money-market linked issues are converted \ninto such if necessary, using fair value hedges. Primarily interest swaps are used as instruments for these fair value \nhedges. To hedge the exchange rate risk, spot transactions, currency options, currency swaps, forward exchange \ntransactions or statement of financial position items are used in a secured currency. \nIf the market circumstances so necessitate, cashflow hedges are used to turn money-market linked transactions into \nfixed-interest transactions and thus to reduce the interest yield risk to guarantee minimum interest.  \nTo reduce the complexity on the basis of the planned conversion of the treasury systems and the transition from IAS \n39 to IFRS 9 as at 1 January 2018, all hedges for own issues and term deposits (fair value hedges) with a total volume \nof EUR 129.6 million were reversed in 2017. The adjustment of the underlying transaction relating to the respective \nhedged risk totalling EUR 23.0 million is reversed over the remaining term to maturity of the hedged risk and shown in \nthe income statement under “Net interest income”. EUR 2.6 million was recognised in the income statement in the \nreporting period due to this reversal. \n25.  Netting of financial assets and liabilities \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group uses repurchase agreements and ISDA master agreements to reduce the credit \nrisk of derivatives and financing transactions. These derivatives and the respective variation margins and contracts \nmeet the requirements for netting in the statement of financial position pursuant to the criteria shown.  \nThe effects of offsetting are not material as at the end of the reporting period and are therefore not shown separately. \nLiabilities from variation margins amount  as at 31.12.2024 2.0 EUR million (2023:. 4.7 EUR million). \n \n \n"}

Risk management \nRisk policy and strategy \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group has developed forward-looking risk management guidelines geared to its \nbusiness and risk profile. These rules are based on a clear risk strategy and define general principles, pursuant to \nwhich the entering into risks takes place across the entire group. The risk strategy of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse \nGroup is in compliance with the business strategy and also takes into account the expected influence of external \nenvironmental factors on the planned business and risk developments.  \nThe risk strategy describes both the actual risk profile and the target risk profile, defines the risk management \nprinciples, the strategic goals as well as initiatives for the most important types of risk and sets strategic limits for the \nfundamental financial and non-financial types of risk that are listed in the risk materiality assessment. The risk strategy \nis implemented within the framework of a clearly defined governance structure. This serves to monitor the risk appetite, \nsupplementary key performance ratios and to escalate the exceeding of limits. \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group has chosen the Internet as a medium for the disclosure obligation pursuant to \nArticle 434 of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms \n(Capital Requirements Regulation - CRR) in the European Union and Regulation (EU) No. 876/2019 amending \nRegulation (EU) No. 575/2013.

The rules are \nadapted to the requirements of the business and risk profile of the bank and reflect the strategic goals, i.e. the \nprotection of shareholders and the creditors and the sustainable continuation of the company. \nThe ERM rules are a modular and comprehensive management and control system within the Steiermärkische \nSparkasse Group and are a fundamental part of the control and management instruments across the Group. The ERM \nrules as an effective internal control system incorporates the following components to cover all and in particular the \nregulatory requirements: \n Risk appetite (risk appetite statement (RAS)), limits and risk strategy \n Portfolio and risk analysis including risk materiality assessment, concentration risk management and stress test \n Risk-bearing capacity statement \n Capital allocation and performance management \n Planning of risk indicators \n Recovery and resolution planning \nIn addition to the primary goal of the ICAAP, the ensuring and sustainability of the equity endowment, the ERM \ncomponents are used by the management as support in the implementation of the business strategy. \nRisk appetite \nThe risk appetite defines the maximum level of risk that the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group is willing to accept in \nfollowing its business objectives. The overall approach incorporates a declaration regarding the willingness to take \nrisks, risk limits and the roles and responsibilities of those who supervise the implementation and monitoring of the \nframework for the willingness to take risks. The limit framework (i.e., the risk appetite framework) incorporates risk \nlimits that are defined in the declaration regarding the willingness to take risks and in the risk strategy, industry limits, \nmaximum loan award limits and operational limits.  \nThe risk appetite statement (RAS) of the group serves as a strategic basis that defines the maximum tolerable risk in \norder to achieve the company targets within the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group. The RAS constitutes, through the \nlimits approved by the Management Board and the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board and recognised by the \nSupervisory Board, a binding restriction within the overall risk appetite of the business activities of the Steiermärkische \nSparkasse Group. It is integrated and embedded in the structural processes such as business and risk strategy, \nbudgeting, capital and liquidity planning, recovery plan, stress testing and remuneration framework. In addition, the \nRAS consists of key performance ratios (capital, liquidity, risk-earnings profile) for the quantitative risk/return \nmanagement and qualitative statements in the form of fundamental risk principles that form a part of the risk \nmanagement guidelines.  \nThe core risk performance ratios stipulate the thresholds for the risk/return objective and form a fundamental input in \nthe annual strategy and budget planning in order to create a holistic perspective of capital, liquidity and the risk/yield \ncompensation. The main goal of the RAS is: \n to ensure that the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group has sufficient resources to guarantee business operations at \nany time and to absorb stress events,  \n to establish tolerance thresholds for the risk objectives of the Group and \n to ensure the financial strength of the Group and the robustness of its systems and checks. \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 89, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n88\nThe establishment of the RAS at Group level is done with foresight in order to strengthen the risk/yield management \nand to guarantee a proactive management of the risk profile. External specifications, such as regulatory requirements, \nset the limits for the RAS and thus the risk that the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group is willing to take. In order to \nensure that the Group operates within the risk appetite set as a goal, a traffic light system is applied for all key \nperformance ratios. This approach facilitates the prompt forwarding of information to the management envisaged in \nthe governance phase and the implementation of effective risk-minimising countermeasures. The RAS traffic light \nsystem is defined as follows: \n RAS is green: The goals of the risk-yield control are within the defined thresholds \n RAS is amber: The undercutting or exceeding of a pre-defined threshold value leads to an exchange of information \nand discussion determined in the governance process for the definition of potential countermeasures. \n RAS is red: The undercutting or exceeding of the pre-defined limit triggers an immediate escalation within the \nframework of the governance process and immediate introduction of countermeasures. \nIn addition, stressed thresholds for selected core RAS been defined, which are integrated into the assessment of \nstress test results and reported to the Management Board as an early warning indicator, thereby assisting in the \nproactive management of the risk and capital profile. \nIn addition, based on the risk appetite of the Group, supplementary risk key ratios and principles are defined for the \nfundamental risk types of the risk strategy. These key performance ratios and principles support the implementation \nof the medium and long-term strategy. This management guarantees a comprehensive control of the risk decisions \nand an implementation of the risk strategy. Countermeasures are introduced as part of the regular risk management \nprocess in order remain within the risk appetite. \nThe risk appetite of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group is broken down, taking into account the approved \nproportionality guidelines, onto the relevant local subsidiaries. The local RAS is subject to the approval of the local \nmanagement boards and the Management Board of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group, and is consistent with the \nGroup RAS. In addition, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group can define further mandatory requirements and limits in \nthe local RAS in order to ensure compliance with the Group RAS and the risk strategy. \nIn addition, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group has further developed an aggregated and consolidated RAS \noverview, the Risk Dashboard, that depicts the developments of the group’s risk profile and that of the local units by \ncomparing the risk potential and the risk limits. The Risk Dashboard is regularly presented to the Management Board \nand key extracts from it to the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board in order to support the review, supervision \nand monitoring of the risk profile of the Group and of the local subsidiaries. \nESG risk drivers are established in the risk appetite and in the risk strategy and are also part of the risk materiality \nassessment of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group. They are integrated in the risk taxonomy as general or \ntransversal risk drivers that influence the main risk categories such as credit, market, liquidity, non-financial risks (NFR) \nand other risks. \nPortfolio and risk analysis \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group uses infrastructure, systems and processes with the aid of which the portfolio \nrisks entered into are identified, measured, controlled, reported and managed. Portfolio and risk analysis procedures \nare designed for the quantification, qualification and discussion of the risks in order to inform the company \nmanagement in a timely manner. \nRisk materiality assessment \nThe risk materiality assessment (RMA) is a regular process for identifying risk and to evaluate potential effects of these \nrisks on the Group’s risk profile. It serves the management as a control instrument in decision with regard to the \nallocation of economic capital in Pillar 2 (ICAAP) or of liquidity buffers in the ILAAP (Internal Liquidity Adequacy \nAssessment Process), and in the definition of further risk control measures. Risk control and mitigation measures are \nadapted to the specific characteristics of each individual risk, whereby there are general specifications corresponding \nto the respective materiality level that have to be complied with. \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 90, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n89\nIn addition, the RMA provides decisive inputs for various risk management activities such as the definition of priorities \nand strategic measures as part of the Group’s risk strategy, the definition of limits within the risk appetite and the \nscenario design for the comprehensive stress test. \nConcentration risk management \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group has implemented a process in order to identify, measure, control and manage \nrisk concentrations. This process is important for ensuring the long-term continuation of the Steiermärkische \nSparkasse Group, primarily in a difficult market environment and under difficult economic conditions. \nThe risk concentration analysis of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group is carried out on an annual basis and takes \ninto account concentrations within the credit, market, liquidity and operational risk as well as risk-overarching \nconcentrations. Risk concentrations that are determined are taken into consideration for the scenario configuration of \nthe comprehensive stress test and measured under stress conditions. The result of the risk concentration analysis \nalso contributes to the recognition of fundamental risks within the framework of the risk materiality assessment and \nto the definition and calibration of the limit system of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group. \nStress tests \nThe modelling of sensitivities of assets and liabilities as well as the profits and losses provide management and control \ninformation and help to optimise the risk/yield profile of the Group. In addition, stress tests help to strengthen the \nrobustness of the risk calculation, control and management through consideration of serious but entirely plausible \nscenarios. Risk modelling and stress tests are fundamental and forward-looking elements of the internal capital \nadequacy process. Sensitivities and stress scenarios are taken into account in the planning process. \nThe complex stress test tasks are scenario stress tests in which the effects of various economic scenarios, including \nfeedback effects on all material risk types (credit, market, liquidity and operational risk) are taken into comprehensive \naccount. In addition, effects on the respective volumes of assets and liabilities as well as profit and loss sensitivities \nare included. Reverse stress tests as well as the standard scenario stress tests are carried out. These are used to \nidentify a scenario or a combination of scenarios that tests the viability of the current business model. \nSpecial tests are used for stress tests in order to transfer the effect of certain macroeconomic variables (e.g. GDP or \nunemployment rates) to risk parameters that depict a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches. In the \ndefinition of stress parameters, sufficient granularity taking account of particular features is particularly important (e.g. \nspecific developments in countries, industries or segments). \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group has integrated climate risks in the comprehensive stress test. In particular, both \nphysical risk as well as transition risks based on forecast climate changes are included. The further development of \nthe climate-based stress analysis will support the strategic overall approach of the Group regarding the climate risk. \nThe results of the in-house stress test are analysed in order to be able to decide on suitable countermeasures if \nnecessary. The comprehensive stress test last created did not show any breach of the stressed RAS threshold values. \nRisk-bearing capacity statement  \nThe calculation of capital adequacy defines the method of calculating capital adequacy for Pillar 2. In contrast to the \nnormative perspective of Pillar 1 which relates to the Group’s ability to fulfil all capital-related regulatory and \nsupervisory requirements, the RTFR is based on an economic perspective of the approach of Pillar 1+, assuming the \ncontinuation of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group in accordance with the ECB guidelines for ICAAP and determines \nwhether the Group has sufficient capital in order to cover all relevant risks to which it is exposed. The economic and \nthe normative perspective are integrated in all fundamental business management activities and decisions. With this \napproach, the Group increases efficiency and ensures the comparability with the Pillar 1 calculation. On the basis of \nthe results of the risk materiality assessment, the economic capital for the relevant risk types is taken into account as \napproved by the Management Board. The economic capital requirements are then compared with the internally \navailable capital (cover potential) in order to cover the risks of the Group in Pillar 2. Both the economic capital and the \ncoverage potential are calculated on the basis of the CRR consolidated group of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group \nas the parent company and on the basis of the IFRS accounting standards. \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 91, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n90\nIn addition to the conventional Pillar 1 risk types (credit, market and operational risk), the concentration risk, interest \nrate risk in the non-trading book, exchange rate risks from equity investments, the credit spread risk in the non-trading \nbook, risks from foreign currency loans (in the SEE subsidiaries) and business risk in the determination of economic \ncapital requirements are explicitly taken into account from a yearly perspective with a statistical probability level of \n99.9%. Within the framework of a conservative risk management policy and strategy, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse \nGroup does not take into consideration any diversification effects between the different types of risk (credit risk, \nmarket risk and operational risk). The majority of the economic capital requirements comes from the credit risk which \nat the end of 2024 accounted for 51.9% of the entire economic capital requirements. \nThe calculation of the internal capital or coverage potential which is necessary to cover the risks and the unexpected \nlosses of Pillar 2 is based on the Pillar 1+ approach, i.e. on the final own funds under supervisory law supplemented \nby Pillar 2 adjustments that are necessary to determine the capital available internally which is seen as risk-bearing \nand loss-absorbing from an economic perspective (e.g. exclusion from Tier 2 capital instruments, Pillar 2 IRB \nsurplus/shortfall of the expected loss, etc.).  \nThe coverage potential must be sufficient in order to compensate for risks / unexpected losses of Pillar 2 that arise \nfrom the business activity of the Group, at any time (in normal and stressed form). At the end of 2024, the economic \ncapital adequacy was 41.6% and thus compliant with the Group RAS. \nThe Management Board, the risk management committees and the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board are \ninformed on a quarterly basis about the results of the risk-bearing capacity statement. It shows changes in risks, the \navailable capital (coverage potential), possible losses due to stress situations, the utilisation of risk limits and the \noverall ICAAP status. \nRisk planning \nThe risk planning framework is essential for the capital allocation and for the comprehensive financial planning process \nand facilitates an appropriate consideration within the strategy, the control and the management process of the Group. \nMethods and instruments used \nThe most important risk indicators that are covered by the risk planning framework include indicators that provide an \noverview of risks that have already arisen or could arise with regard to developments of the portfolio and the economic \nenvironment. Indicators include risk-weighted assets (and respective indicators), portfolio quarterly indicators (loss \nallowances, NPL/NPE and relevant performance indicators, etc.) and indicators required under supervisory law. \nThe planning activities are carried out in close collaboration with all stakeholders in the entire process of the Group \nand follow a clear governance that guarantees a well-found risk planning process. \nTotal equity requirement by risk type \nThe following graphic shows the distribution of economic equity requirements by risk type. \n"}

On 7 June 2019, a legislative banking package (EU Banking Package) was announced in the Official Journal \nof the European Union. This EU banking package includes, in the respective version, Directive (EU) No. 2013/36 (CRD \nIV) and Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (CRR) and the BRRD and Regulation (EU) No. 806/2014 (SRMR). The EU \nBanking Package entered into force on 27 June 2019 and was implemented in national law in Austria on 28 June \n2021.  \nRecovery planning. The Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group sends an updated Group recovery plan to the Erste Group \nevery year. Pursuant to the requirements of the Federal Law on the Recovery and Resolution of Banks (BaSAG), Erste \nGroup sends a group recovery plan to the Joint Supervisory Team (JST) every year. The Group recovery plan is \nregularly assessed by the ECB. It describes potential measures for the restocking of the capital and liquidity resources \nof the bank in order to be able to manage a number of both idiosyncratic and market-wide stress scenarios. The \nrecovery framework is largely coordinated with the risk appetite framework with regard to indicators and their limits \nin order to ensure a comprehensive enterprise-wide risk management. It is decisive here that in a serious crisis \nsituation close to the default or impending default of the bank sufficient recovery capacity is available in order to be \nable to take the recovery indicators back into the green area again. The sequence of reporting defined in the recovery \nplan facilitates a prompt and appropriate possibility of intervention in the event of recovery. In addition, the assessment \nof the Group recovery plan and the classification of the entire recovery capacity is part of the SREP (Supervisory \nReview and Evaluation Process) assessment. \nResolution planning. The Erste Group collaborates in the creation of resolution plans through the resolution authorities \nthat are envisaged in the BaSAG and Resolution (EU) No. 806/2014 on the uniform resolution mechanism (SRM \nRegulation).

The data \nwere first collected and reported after consultation with the financial market authority and the OeNB as at \n31 December 2014. \nThe regulatory consolidated group satisfies the regulatory requirements defined in CRR and the Austrian Banking Act \n(BWG). The latter transposes the requirements of CRD IV and CRD V1 into national law. \nMain differences between the IFRS and regulatory consolidated groups due to the different requirements under IFRS, \nCRR and BWG: \nAccording to CRR and the Banking Act (BWG), the consolidated group under supervisory law primarily includes banks \npursuant to Article 4 (1) (1) CRR, securities trading firms pursuant to Article 4 (1) (2) CRR, providers of ancillary \nservices pursuant to Article 4 (1) (18) CRR and financial institutions pursuant to Article 4 (1) (26) CRR. By contrast, in \naccordance with IFRS, all other entities that are not consolidated according to CRR, such as insurance companies, \nmust be included in the IFRS consolidated group. \nPursuant to the CRR, companies can be excluded from the consolidated group pursuant to supervisory law. Pursuant \nto Article 19 (1) CRR, companies can be excluded from the consolidated group pursuant to supervisory law if the total \nsum of their assets and off-balance-sheet positions is below the lower of the two following amounts: EUR 10 million \nor 1% of the total sum of the assets and off-balance-sheet positions of the parent company. The Erste Group and the \nSteiermärkische Sparkasse Group apply Article 19(1) CRR. \nPursuant to Article 19 (2) CRR, companies can also be excluded if the thresholds defined in Article 19 (1) CRR are \nexceeded but the companies can be neglected under supervisory law. The exclusion of entities on the basis of Article \n19(2) CRR requires prior approval by the competent authorities. The Erste Group and the Steiermärkische Sparkasse \nGroup apply Article 19 (2) CRR for companies that only exceed the thresholds defined in Article 19 (1) CRR \ninsignificantly and complies with the requirements for the approval process that are also defined in this article. The \nErste Group and the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group do not apply Article 19(2) CRR to credit institutions and \ninvestment firms. Steiermärkische Sparkasse applies Article 19(2) CRR in the same way. \nThe Austrian savings banks are subsidiaries of the Erste Group and, due to the joint liability agreements, a part of the \nconsolidated group. Moreover, Erste Group Bank AG together with the savings banks forms an institutional protection \nscheme as defined by Article 113(7) CRR. The publication requirements for the institutional protection scheme \naccording to Article 113 (7) e CRR are met by the publication of the consolidated financial statements of Erste Group \nBank AG, which include all members of the institutional protection scheme. \nThe own funds pursuant to CRR comprise the Common Equity Tier 1 - CET 1, the Additional Tier 1 - AT 1 and the Tier \n2 - T2. To determine the capital ratios, the respective capital components are compared with the overall risk after \nconsideration of all regulatory deductions and filters. \n \n1 Implementation of the CRD V was done by the BWG Amendment (Federal Law Gazette [BGBl.] I 2021/98) and entered into force on 31.05.2021. \n"}

The Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group uses industry strategies and loan award standards in order to \nsupport portfolio management with regard to ESG risks.  \nIn addition, an ESG risk framework was introduced in the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group to assess material ESG \nfactors and the associated risks in the credit process. In this way, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group takes ESG \nrisk criteria into account in loan decisions. \nIn major corporate, commercial real estate and residential real estate transactions, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse \nGroup conducts a systematic ESG analysis based on an internal, digital ESG assessment questionnaire. The \nquestionnaire is a mandatory requirement within the framework of the loan and monitoring process. Through a \ncomprehensive ESG risk assessment, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group can establish the positive or negative \ninfluence of ESG factors on the customers’ financial performance. The questionnaire makes it possible to identify ESG \nrisks or ESG opportunities of the customers. \nCertain questions in the questionnaire can also require an accompanying assessment in order to understand the type \nand severity of the ESG risks that the customers are exposed to. The questionnaire is an important part of defined \nloan applications and is updated at least once a year; it makes it possible for the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group to \nunderstand the business model of the customers in connection with the transition to a low-carbon economy.  \nIn addition, ESG-relevant data are collected for certain types of securities pursuant to the definitions included in the \nGroup Collateral Management Policy for the valuation, documentation and reporting of real estate collateral. \nEnvironmental aspects that influence the value of the collateral must be taken into account in the real estate valuation, \nwhich can result in a higher or lower valuation result. In addition, risks also need to be taken into account that result \nfrom social (e.g. location and transport, mass urbanisation - as indicators for the easy accessibility for the population) \nand governance factors (such as inappropriate business practices such as tax evasion or bribing of the financed \ncompany that is the owner of the building serving as collateral). For commercial real estate of a certain size, ESG-\nrelevant information incl. calculations of the ecological footprint of the building, including information about the use of \nspace, the space efficiency and the existence of a certification as a sustainable building is collected in the course of \nthe “Technical Object Rating”.  \nThrough ESG risks, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group is confronted with additional challenges. With regard to the \nmeasurement of the credit risk and the internal models, a corresponding project was started in 2022 in the Erste \nGroup to define and record relevant climate risk drivers for rating systems in order to explicitly ensure the consideration \nof climate risks in future model development initiatives. With the LGD models, the climate risk is taken into \nconsideration indirectly via the collateral value. Since 2023, ESG factors have been taken into consideration in the \ncompany rating as soft facts. \nIt is also analysed how ESG risks can be integrated in the measurement of the expected credit loss. As of 31 December \n2024, no overlays are seen as necessary for this. \nFor the valuation and the management of physical risks, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group uses intelligence data \nfrom Munich Re. In the past year, the Erste Group, together with the University of Graz, conducted a materiality test \nof physical risks in order to identify the most important risks and climate change scenarios that are relevant for the \ncollateral portfolio. The results of this analysis, which emphasise the significance of flooding, fire, drought, rise in sea \nlevel, and heat, are integrated in the collateral management, whereby a moderate climate change scenario of a 2 to \n3 ° C rise in temperature until 2100 (Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 / Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2, \ndeveloped by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) is used as a reasonable assumption. In the case of very \nhigh physical risks for a location, the collateral value would be negatively influenced. \nIn order to evaluate the potential effects of the physical risk, a model developed internally for physical climate risks \nwas used within the framework of the internal stress test. Applying the climate risk scores provided by Munich Re for \nthe collateral of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group, the flooding risk was defined as the most important risk for the \nSteiermärkische Sparkasse Group. \n"}

For the \ncement production, automotive manufacturing and oil and gas upstream sectors, joint Sparkassen goals were defined \nthat are supported by the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group. \nMethods of credit risk management \nCredit risks develop in the classical credit and investment business of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group.  \nOperative loan decisions are taken by the local units responsible for the credit risk management and at Group level by \nthe Operative Credit Risk Management. \nIn compliance with EU-wide and local regulatory requirements, the credit risk management in the retail and corporate \nbusiness takes into consideration the strategic alignment of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group and provides \nprivate individuals as well as small and medium-sized enterprises with loans within their financial capacities. \nInternal rating system \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group regulates its credit guidelines and credit approval procedures within the \nframework of business and risk strategies. The policies are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, adapted at least once \na year. Taking into account the type, the scope and the risk content of the transactions and borrowers concerned, \nthey cover the entire credit award process. When approving credit, individual information such as the credit rating of \nthe customer, the credit type, the collateralisation, the contractual configuration and other risk-reducing factors are \ntaken into account. \nThe loan default risk is assessed in the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group on the basis of the default probability of the \ncustomers. For each credit commitment and within the framework of each credit decision, the Steiermärkische \nSparkasse Group awards a rating as a specific measurement for the loan default risk (internal rating). The internal \nrating of all customers is updated on an ad hoc basis, but at least once a year (annual rating review). This is done at \ncorrespondingly shorter intervals for customers in workout. \nThe main purpose of the internal ratings is their use in the decision-making process for lending and in stipulating the \nterms and conditions of loans. In addition, as a result of the internal ratings, the necessary competence level within \nthe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group and the monitoring procedures for existing receivables are also determined. On \nthe quantitative level, the internal ratings influence the necessary risk costs, the loss allowances and, if applicable, \nthe risk-weighted assets according to Pillar 1 and 2. \nFor Group companies that use the approach based on internal ratings (IRB), internal ratings are a fundamental input \nparameter to determine the risk-weighted assets. They are also used in the Group-wide calculation of economic equity \nrequirements in accordance with Pillar 2. A default probability is indicated for this within the framework of the \ncalibration process for the portfolios of every risk category. The calibration is done individually for each rating method. \nDefault probabilities constitute a 1-year default probability based on long-term average default rates. In addition, the \nbank adds safety margins to the calculated default probabilities. \nAll available information fundamental for the assessment of the loan default risk is incorporated into internal ratings. \nIn the event of borrowers that cannot be assigned to the retail private sector, the internal ratings take into account the \nfinancial strength of the customer, the possibility of external support, flexibility in the company financing, general \ncompany data and, if applicable, historical credit rating data from external sources. In the case of retail private \ncustomers, internal ratings are primarily based on data about the payment behaviour towards the bank (if available) \nand, if applicable, financial information from credit information agencies and they also take into account information \nthat is provided by the respective customer, and general demographic data. Upper thresholds for the rating are applied \n"}

All rating models are the object of an annual review of their \nestimates that includes the incorporation of the latest data into the estimate of the risk parameters, and also a regular \ncomplete model audit. This model development follows uniform standards across the Group with regard to \nmethodology and documentation and is based on the relevant data of the respective market. This guarantees the \navailability of rating models with the highest possible forecasting accuracy and ability to differentiate risk in all core \ncountries. \nThe central organisational unit of the Erste Group – Model Validation – is responsible for the definition of validation \nmethods and standards that are applied for all credit risk models. All Pillar 1, material Pillar 2 and IFRS9 models are \nsubject to an annual validation, whereas a regular validation cycle is implemented for non-material Pillar 2 and IFRS9 \nmodels. On the validation side, both qualitative and quantitative methods are applied in order to test the conceptual \naccuracy, the quantitative model quality and the model use. The validation results are adopted in the corresponding \nmodel committees and, in the case of IRB models, then communicated to the supervisory authorities. In addition to \nthe validation, there is a regularly review of the performance of the IRB rating models, among others based on the \nchanges in the number of new defaults and early phases of payment arrears. \nApprovals of all new models, model changes, amendments in risk parameters, amendments in the Group-wide \nmethodological standards and other model-based aspects are issued according to the dual approval procedure within \nthe Group. The corresponding structures of the holding and of the local model committee reflect joint responsibilities \nfor decisions regarding Pillar 1 IRB and Pillar 2 credit risk models as well as for methods regarding IFRS 9 parameters. \nResponsibilities are assigned depending on the scope of the model (Group-wide or locally developed models). In this \ncontext, the committees Strategic Risk Executive Committee and Strategic Risk Management Committee in the Erste \nGroup and the Risk Management Team (comprising representatives of defined Sparkassen and the Erste Group) have \nbeen set up. \nThe ultimate responsibility for all models that are used within the Erste Group (on a consolidated level) lies with the \nGroup CRO. \nClassification of credit risk \nFor the purpose of reporting with regard to the loan quality, the customers of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group \nare consolidated in the following four risk categories: \nLow risk. Typical regional customers with a stable, long-standing relationship with the Steiermärkische Sparkasse \nGroup or large, internationally renowned customers. Very good to satisfactory financial situation; low probability of \noccurrence of financial difficulties compared to the respective market in which the customers operate. Retail \ncustomers with a long-standing business relationship to the bank or customers who use a broad range of products. \nNo relevant payment arrears currently or in the last twelve months. New business is typically performed with \ncustomers in this risk category. \nRequiring comment. Potentially liable non-retail customers who perhaps already had payment arrears/defaults in the \npast or could have difficulties in the repayment of debts in the medium term. Retail customers with possible payment \nproblems in the past that led to an early reminder. These customers recently demonstrated good payment behaviour. \nElevated risk. The borrower is prone in the short term to negative financial and economic developments and has an \nincreased default probability. In some cases, restructuring measures are impending or have already been carried out. \nSuch receivables are usually handled in specialised risk management departments. \nNon-performing. At least one of the default criteria according to Article 178 CRR applies to the borrower, among \nothers, full repayment improbable, interest or capital repayments of a fundamental receivable overdue by more than \n90 days; debt restructuring with loss for borrower; realisation of a loss or opening of insolvency proceedings. For all \ncustomer segments, including retail customers, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group uses the customer perspective; \n"}

All non-performing receivables are also seen as defaulted.  \nThe materiality threshold for the determination of 90-days overdue receivables is applied for statement of financial \nposition risk positions on customer level and compared daily with the materiality threshold defined throughout the \nGroup (unless the local supervisory authority stipulates other threshold values). \n For retail customers there is an absolute threshold of EUR 100 and a relative threshold of 1%. \n For non-retail customers there is an absolute threshold of EUR 500 and a relative threshold of 1%. \nOn the basis of the calibration of internal probabilities of default (probabilities of default, PDs) for regulatory purposes \nto the default rates published by rating agencies, the corresponding external customer rating is used for the allocation \nto risk categories. Average one-year default rates from long-term periods are used for the ratings of rating agencies. \nThe Bosnian supervisory authority has issued a temporary regulation for local banks that states that an increase in \ninterest of more than 2% for private customer loans may not result in any default. That is why as of 31 December \n2024 a credit risk volume of EUR 1.6 million is held in Stage 2 instead of Stage 3 in the retail portfolio concerned.  \nReviewing and monitoring credit risks \n \nAll credit limits and transactions within these limits are reviewed at least once a year. Customer-related credit risk \nlimits are monitored on a daily basis by the internal limit management system and in the event of limits being exceeded \nthe necessary measures are introduced. \nA standardised early warning system has been implemented throughout the Group for the forward-looking recognition \nof negative developments. The early warning indicators are monitored by the local units of the operational risk \nmanagement and the workout management for the respective segments. If early warning signals are established and \nvalidated, a review of the entire customer exposure and the credit rating will be performed. If necessary, appropriate \nmeasures to reduce risk will be initiated. Within the framework of regular watchlist discussions, customers with a poor \ncredit rating will be monitored and precautionary measures discussed. The monitoring and credit rating check of \nsmaller companies and of retail customers is based on an automated early warning system. In retail risk management, \namong others, a deterioration in quality in new commitments or declining effectiveness in the collection of receivables \nare signs of potential unfavourable portfolio developments and require appropriate countermeasures. In addition, the \nmonitoring for the customers is performed for whom early warning signals have been established, even if they still \ncomply with the contractual repayment obligations.  \nNegative developments of the non-performing loans and the loans with an increased risk are regularly monitored, \ndiscussed and reported. In the event of further negative developments, the customers are supported by units \nspecialised in workout in order to maximise repayments. \n \n \n"}

Use of collateral \nRecognition of collateral \nCollateral management is integrated in the Strategic or Operative Risk Management department. With the “Group \nCollateral Management Policy Part 1 Credit Collateral” or with the “Liability Scheme Collateral Management Policy”, \namong others, group-wide uniform valuation standards for loan securities are determined. It is thus ensured that the \nloan decision process is standardised with regard to the collateral values used.  \nAll collateral permitted within the Group are shown in the Group Collateral Catalogue. The locally approved securities \nare defined by the respective bank, taking into account the applicable national legal provisions. The valuation and new \nvaluation of the securities is done according to specified principles, differentiated according to the type of security \nand on the basis of internal work instructions that are oriented to the regulations of supervisory law. Whether a type \nof security defined individual securities can be recognised to reduce the credit risk for the regulatory calculation of \nown funds is, after a check whether the respective regulatory requirements are met, subject to a decision by the \nenterprise-wide risk management of the Erste Group. The operational risk management monitors compliance with the \nprocesses specified for the classification of the eligible collateral in the envisaged categories. \nMain types of credit securities \nIn most cases, the following collateral is accepted: \n real estate: both residential and commercially used real estate; \n financial securities: securities and account balances as well as life insurances; \n guarantees: issued by countries, the public sector, financial institutes, companies and private individuals. All \nguarantors must have a minimum credit rating, which is checked annually. \n movable assets: company equipment, goods, machines and vehicles; \n receivables and rights: trade receivables, leasehold rights, share rights to companies. \nValuation and management of securities  \nThe securities are valued on the basis of current market values, taking into account utilisation proceeds to be \ngenerated over an appropriate period of time. The valuation proceedings are specified and their technical application \nis done using IT by authorised employees in the respective countries. The upper limit for eligible collateral is equal to \nthe amount of the collateralised transaction.  \nThe valuation of real estate may only be done by expert appraisers independent of the credit decision process \naccording to international, European or national standards, whereby the valuation procedures to be applied are \nspecified to the appraisers. The selection of the appraisers is done according to internally defined criteria with regard \nto their qualification and independence. An appraiser can only appraise a property two consecutive times; then the \nappraisal has to be done by another appraiser. In order to ensure quality, the property appraisers and valuations are \nconstantly reviewed. \nThe estimates and discounts used for the valuation are based on experiences gained in the past by the credit \nrestructuring departments and the results from the revenues data collection from the utilisation of the securities. The \nvaluation rates are adjusted regularly –  at least yearly –  to the realisation proceeds, taking into account foreseeable \nscenarios (such as expected real estate price development based on elemental events). \nCollateral is periodically remeasured; this process is automated as far as possible. In the case of external sources of \ndata, corresponding interfaces will be used. The maximum deadlines for the remeasurement of individual collateral \nare prescribed and their fulfilment is monitored by Risk Management with system support. Independently of the new \nvaluation to be carried out on a periodic basic, this also has to be done when information is available that indicates \nthe reduction of the value of the securities or defined threshold values are exceeded. Particularly real estate being \ndeveloped with significant exceeding of costs or time, as well as real estate secured with loans with an increased risk, \nare monitored or revalued with a higher frequency. \n"}

Measurement of the expected credit loss \nThe general principles and standards regarding loss allowances for credit losses are regulated at the Steiermärkische \nSparkasse Group in internal guidelines. In accordance with IFRS 9, loan loss allowances are calculated for all items of \ncredit risk exposure that are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. They \nincorporate bonds, loans and advances, sight deposits on nostro accounts at business banks, receivables from \nfinancing leasing and trade receivables. In addition, loss allowances for financial guarantees and non-utilised credit \ncommitments are calculated if they fall under the area of application of the IFRS 9 provisions. \nClassification to stages and definition of impaired financial instruments \nThree stages are shown for the determination of the expected credit loss (ECL). The stage approach is used for \nfinancial instruments subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9 that are not already purchased or originated \ncredit-impaired (POCI) financial assets at the time of accrual. The latter form a separate category. The assignment of \nthe financial instruments to one of the three stages depends on the status of the impairment and the assessment of \nthe development of the credit risk. The three stages are described in the chapter “Financial instruments - Material \naccounting principles”, in the section “Impairments of financial instruments”. \nDetermination of a significant increase in the credit risk \nThe determination of a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) between initial recognition and the end of the reporting \nperiod is one of the key factors for the recognition of the expected credit loss in accordance with IFRS 9. For this \npurpose, quantitative and qualitative indicators for the determination of a significant increase in the credit risk are \ndefined across all portfolios and product types, including those overdue by more than 30 days. \nQuantitative criteria. Quantitative indicators for the determination of a significant increase in the credit risk include \ndisadvantageous changes to the lifetime probability of default (LT PD) calculated over the entire term, during which \nthe significance is determined by means of a comparison with the change thresholds. Thresholds have been defined \nfor significant increases in credit risk that relate to both relative and absolute changes in the probability of default \nsince initial recognition. A significant increase in the credit risk results when both relative and absolute threshold values \nare exceeded. \nThe ratio of current annualised total term default probability and annualised total term default probability at initial \nrecognition is calculated as a relative parameter, whereby in each case the residual term of the financial instrument is \ntaken into consideration. A defined threshold is exceeded if this indicator is equal to or higher than the threshold. \nThese relative thresholds to determine a significant increase in the credit risk are determined at the level of customer \nsegments or as required on the level of the customer rating for the Group company and are subject to a first-time and \ncontinuous validation. \nThere are some portfolios for which the quantitative criteria of a significant increase in the credit risk are determined \non the basis of the nominal ratings instead of on the basis of the probability of default. If a downgrading exceeds a \npre-determined number of rating stages, this results in a significant increase in the credit risk. This rule is applied \nabove all to lease and factoring receivables. \nThe absolute threshold refers to the difference between the total lifetime probability of default when used for the first \ntime and the residual term probability of default at the current point in time, whereby annualised or cumulative figures \nare used. The threshold is defined at a maximum of 50 base points and serves as a security threshold (backstop) for \nmigrations within the best rating stages. In such cases, relative threshold values can be exceeded but as the probability \nof default expected over the total term is very low overall, this does not trigger any significant increase in the credit \nrisk. \n \n \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 108, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n107\nQualitative criteria. Qualitative indicators for the determination of a significant increase in the credit risk incorporate \nthe taking of deferral measures and the transfer of the customer support to the Workout department and early warning \nindicators and information about fraud. The determination of some qualitative indicators is based inherently on the \nexpert assessment of credit risks that has to be done appropriately and in a timely manner. The Group-wide guidelines \nand processes specific to the institute in this regard (which were adapted in the course of the changeover to IFRS 9 \nif necessary) guarantee the necessary management framework. These indicators are used internally to recognise an \ninsolvency or a higher probability that the borrower will become bankrupt or that an increased risk of default exists for \na foreseeable period of time.  \nIn addition to the qualitative determinants on the customer level, the determination of a significant increase in the \ncredit risk is carried out on portfolio level if the increase in the credit risk at transaction or customer level only occurs \nafter a certain delay or if it is only discernible on portfolio level.  \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group has introduced additional criteria for the collection valuation of a significant \nincrease in the credit risk based on numerous geopolitical conflicts and the resulting macroeconomic effects on \nportfolio level. \nSecurity threshold (backstop) \nA security threshold is used by there being a significant increase in the credit risk when contractual payment \nobligations are overdue by more than 30 days. The validation found that this criterion is not a material trigger for a \nStage 2 classification. \nCalculation of the expected credit loss – Explanations on input data and evaluation \nImpairments are calculated on individual level or on portfolio level. \nThe individual calculation method is applied for fundamentally defaulted customers in Stage 3 or POCI. It involves \nindividually determining the difference between the gross carrying amount and present value of the expected cash \nflows estimated by workout risk managers. They are discounted on the basis of the effective interest rate (for POCI \nfinancial instruments on the basis of the credit-adjusted effective interest rate). In the case of financial guarantees, \nthe discounting rate should, however, reflect the current market estimates of the monetary value and of the specific \nrisk of the cashflow. As implemented by the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group, this means applying a risk-free interest \nrate as an approximation. \nA customer who has defaulted is classified as individually significant if the entire statement of financial position and \noff-balance-sheet credit risk volume is above a certain materiality threshold. Otherwise, the customer is classified as \ninsignificant, whereby a rule-based approach is taken for the calculation of loan loss allowances. In this approach, \nloan loss allowances are calculated as the product of gross carrying amount and loss given default, whereby loss given \ndefault depends among other things on the duration of the default and the status of recovery and resolution processes. \nloss allowances for receivables towards non-defaulted customers (i.e. financial instruments in Stage 1 and Stage 2) \nare calculated independently of their amount on the basis of a rule-based approach. In the calculation of rule-based \nloss allowances, the corresponding risk positions must be grouped into homogeneous clusters on the basis of common \nrisk characteristics. The criteria for the grouping can vary according to customer segment (retail customers, corporate \ncustomers) and include product type, collateral type, repayment type, loan-to-value ranges and rating ranges. \nThe loss allowances for credit losses are calculated on a monthly basis in the contractual currency on the level of the \nindividual risk positions. For the calculation of loss allowances, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group uses an \nimpairment model on the basis of a three-stage approach, which gives twelve-month or lifetime expected credit loss. \nThe expected credit loss is the product of discounted exposure at default (EAD), which includes a credit conversion \nfactor (CCF) for Off-balance-sheet items, multiplied by probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD). The \nparameters are defined as follows:  \n PD stands for the probability that an obligor does not meet its financial obligations and defaults, either during the \nnext 12 months (one-year probability of default, 1Y PD) for risk positions in Stage 1 or during the remaining total \nterm (“lifetime probability of default, LT PD) for risk positions in the Stages 2 and 3 and for POCI risk positions. \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 109, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n108\n EAD is the amount that the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group expects to be owed at the time of default, either over \nthe next twelve months (one-year exposure at default, 1Y EAD) for risk positions in Stage 1 or over the remaining \nlifetime (lifetime exposure at default, LT EAD) for risk positions Stage 2 and 3 and POCI risk positions. The estimate \nincludes the current balance, the expected repayments and the expected drawings within the agreed framework \nuntil the time of default. \n LGD embodies the expectation of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group with regard to the amount of the loss in the \nevent of a defaulted receivable. Loss given default varies according to type of counterparty, type and seniority of \nthe exposure and availability of collateral or other credit support. Loss given default is expressed as a percentage \nof exposure at default (EAD). \nLifetime parameters \nThe lifetime probability of default (lifetime PD) is determined by observing the historical defaults over an available \nhistory. The calculated Lifetime PDs are extrapolated, e.g., through matrix multiplication in order to ensure that the \nfinal Lifetime PD covers the term of the loans from the first time they are recorded. It is assumed to be equal for all \nfinancial assets in the same portfolio and the same rating range. In addition, the risk country is taken into consideration \nas an additionally relevant characteristic for the lifetime PD for the central models of the Group (Large) Corporates \nusing the forward-looking information (FLI). \nOne-year and lifetime exposure at default is calculated using expected payment profiles, which vary according to \nproduct type. The lifetime exposure value is calculated using a repayment schedule or repayment type (annuity, linear, \nbullet). For undrawn loan commitments, the credit conversion factor is estimated to the reflect the expected credit \nrisk exposure at default (EAD). \nLoss given default is estimated on the basis of historical loss observations on a lifetime curve for each point in time. \nThe risk parameters that are used in the calculation of the expected credit losses take into account the information \navailable on the key reporting date regarding past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic \ndevelopments. Due to the characteristics of the respective portfolio and taking into account the IFRS rules, the risk \nparameters that are incorporated into the calculation of the rule-based loss allowances, can deviate from the risk \nparameters that are used in the calculation of the capital requirement and are determined on the basis of a through-\nthe-cycle analysis. \n35.

There is an increase in the loss \nallowances formed due to transfers from Stage 1 to Stage 2 or 3. This is shown in the lines “Stage 2” or “Stage 3”. \nTransfers from Stage 2 or 3 to Stage 1 result in a reversal of loss allowances, which is shown in the “Stage 1” line. \nThe effect with no impact on profit or loss and which arises from the reallocation of the loss allowance amounts \nrecorded before the transfer between the stages is shown in the column “Other changes to the credit risk (net)”. \nAll changes to the credit risk that do not lead to a transfer of the underlying financial instruments from Stage 1 to \nStage 2 or 3 - or conversely - will also be recorded in the column “Other changes to the credit risk (net)”. \nFinancial instruments valued at amortised costs \nDevelopment of the loss allowances for credit risks – Bonds \nin EUR million \nStatus as at \nAdditions \nDerecogniti\nons \nOther \nchanges in \nthe credit \nrisk (net) \nTransfer \nbetween \nstages \nInsignificant \nmodification\ns (net) \nWrite-\ndowns \nOther \nadjustments \nStatus as at \n \nJan. 2024 \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nDec. 2024 \nStage 1 \n-0.1 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n-0.1 \nStage 2 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \nStage 3 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \nTotal \n-0.1 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n0.0 \n-0.1 \n \n"}

Scenarios for the consideration of forward-looking information and crisis \neffects \nOverview of scenarios for the consideration of future-related information \nConsideration of forward-looking information \nThe parameters are determined so that they reflect the risk as a point-in-time measurement taking into account \nforward-looking (FLI) information. A basic forecast and alternative scenarios for selected macroeconomic variables \nare created for this. The alternative scenarios are, jointly with the scenario weighting, derived from the basic forecasts \nthat are created with a few exceptions by the Research department of the Erste Group. With the aid of these scenarios, \nthe \"neutral\" probabilities of default (and in places also the loss in the event of default) are adjusted by macroeconomic \nmodels that establish a link between relevant macroeconomic variables and risk drivers. Forward-looking information \nis taken into account in the determination of the expected credit loss in the first three years. The parameters for the \nremaining term from the 4th year are determined on the basis of cycle-based observations.  \nThe undistorted and scenario-weighted expected credit loss is therefore derived from the weighted results for each \nmacroeconomic scenario using forward-looking information. Typical macroeconomic variables are, for instance, the \nreal gross domestic product (GDP), the unemployment rate and the rate of inflation. The selection of variables is also \ndependent on the availability of reliable forecasts for the respective local market. The main indicator for the estimate \nof the economic development and basis for deriving alternative scenarios is the GDP: In addition, the economic effects \nof the ongoing war in Ukraine and the arising conflicts in the Near East resulted in an increase in inflation and/or the \ninterest rates. The Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group adapted the macro-shift models in order to reflect the expected \neffects on the credit risk parameters.  \nThe FLI macro shift models are regularly recalibrated in order to take into account the most important macro variables, \nwhereby the variables with the highest statistical relevance are included. In the case of the central models for Group \n(Large) Corporates, a separate central organisational unit of the Erste Group is responsible for the review of the lifetime \nPDs, including the future-based information which is based on the risk country and differentiates the macro \ndevelopment in the various countries. \nThe sensitivities when assigning to a stage and loss allowances with regard to macro scenarios are shown in the \nsection Collective Valuation further below. \nCollective valuation \nIn addition to the standard valuation of the significant increase in the credit risk the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group \nuses a collective valuation of the significant increase in the credit risk (stage overlay), i.e., a shift into Stage 2 on the \nbasis of predefined portfolio characteristics in light of newly occurring risks that are not covered by standard models. \nThis approach was agreed with all subsidiaries concerned and approved by the respective management bodies. \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 120, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n119\nExceptions to the collective valuation of the significant increase in the credit risk were necessary if special \ncharacteristics were established and it was duly documented why they behave differently to the rest of the portfolio. \nIn December 2024, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group applied the collective valuation of the significant increase \nin the credit risk for certain sectors. The collective valuation of the significant increase in the credit risk applied in \nDecember 2023 for cyclical industries that is based on the correlation to the economic downturn, and for selected \nindustries from the energy sector (production and distribution of energies and heat), including energy-intensive \nindustries (metal and chemicals) were removed or converted: \n the collective valuation of the significant increase in the credit risk for selected industries from the energy sector \ndue to the distortions on the energy market with impact on the availability and the price of gas/energy: This was \nsuspended in June 2024 on the basis of the regular valuation of the boundary conditions (exit triggers) for the \ncollective valuation of the significant increase in the credit risk. The conclusion was drawn that the risk in the case \nof the energy sector / energy-intensive industries was reduced (sufficient gas reserves in Europe, stabilised energy \nprices). \n The collective valuation of the significant increase in the credit risk for cyclical industries due to the war in Ukraine \nas a combination of industries with a correlation to the economic downturn (cyclical industries) and the one-year \nIFRS-PD. The continuing high inflation and the reduction in available income continue to slow private consumption, \nwhereas the high global uncertainty and the high refinancing conditions are having negative effects on investments \nand industrial activity. Whereas some industries developed better in 2023, which was confirmed by the rating \nreviewed in 2024, others continue to be confronted with high warehouse stocks, ongoing problems in the supply \nchain and cost inflation as well as additionally with reduced demand. The latter is not yet reflected in the customers’ \nfinancial data, and a downgrading of the ratings continues to be expected. That is why the collective valuation of \nthe significant increase in the credit risk for cyclical industries was converted/revalued in November 2024 in order \nto guarantee an improved interlinking with internal risk management processes. The collective valuation of the \nsignificant increase in the credit risk was linked to the industry strategy (industry stage overlay) that reflects risks \nand changes in the risk valuation to which our portfolio is exposed, instead of the previously used general definition \nof cyclical industries. The industry strategy incorporates all twelve corporate industries and their sub-segments. \nThe industries are systematically valued pursuant to the risk management framework of the Erste Group (industry \nstrategies and main risks). However, potential risks have possible not yet manifested themselves on the customer \nlevel and are not yet incorporated in the financial data or ratings of the customers. That is why using a threshold \nvalue that is defined by the one-year IFRS-PD, customers are identified who are potentially affected, which reflects \nthat a better rating classification (and thus PD) defines the credit standing on the customer level. \nWith a part of the retail portfolio at Sparkasse Bank Bosnia, interest rate increases on portfolio level were technically \nlimited by temporary measures. After the end of these measures, the bank assumes that the interest rates will be \nincreased again to a level that corresponds to the original loan agreements. That is why the bank has carried out an \nadditional collective stage valuation for this portfolio. As of 31 December 2024, the affected credit risk volume \namounts to EUR 4.0 million and the additional loss allowances EUR 0.1 million. \nIn November 2024, a new collective valuation of the significant increase of the credit risk was also introduced in \nBosnia and Herzegovina due to flooding in order to cover physical risks. This resulted in an additional credit risk volume \nof EUR 24.5 million in Stage 2 and an increase in the expected credit loss by EUR 0.3 million. \nEffects on the expected credit loss \nThe following analysis tables show the effects of the collective valuation of the significant increase in the credit risk \nand the forward-looking information both on the shift of credit risk volume in Stage 2 and the resulting increase in loss \nallowances.  \nIn December 2024, the credit risk volume in Stage 2 amounted to EUR 1,270.4 million due to the use of collective \nvaluations of the significant increase in the credit risk (2023: EUR 2,444.5 million); thus additional loss allowances in \nthe amount of EUR 22.0 million (2023: EURO 46.3 million) were incurred. \nAs described above, the forward-looking information was re-evaluated on the basis of the latest macro scenarios in \nthe fourth quarter of 2024. Taking into account the review of the model-internal adjustments (application of the \n"}

Additional technical write-down triggers incorporate \nenforcement proceedings, worthlessness of the receivable/securities, legally binding bankruptcy/liquidation or other \neconomic loss of the claims.

Market risk \nDefinition and overview \nThe market risk is the risk of a loss that can occur due to disadvantageous changes in market prices and parameters \nderived from them. These changes in market value can appear in the income statement, in the overall statement of \nrecognised income and expenses or in the hidden reserves. In the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group, market risk is \ndivided into interest rate risk, credit spread risk, currency risk, and share risk. Both trading and non-trading \ntransactions are affected.  \nTrading book according to Article 94 CRR \nIn the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group, a trading book pursuant to Art. 94 CRR is only operated at Steiermärkische \nSparkasse (trading book activity of a low volume). \nSensitivity analysis of market risks \nFor the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group, rate shocks scenarios pursuant to the EBA Regulatory Technical Standard \non the supervisory outlier tests (EBA/RTS/2022/10) with their effects on the future net interest yield are used for the \nsensitivity analysis of market risks.  \nThe following rate shocks scenarios apply: \n Basic scenario \n Parallel upward shock \n Parallel downward shock \n Steepener shock with a curve that becomes steeper  \n Flattener shock with a curve that becomes flatter  \n Upward shock in the case of short-term interest rates \n Downward shock in the case of short-term interest rates \nThe following cumulative values result for the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group: \nin EUR million \nNet interest \nincome \nDifference to basic \nscenario \nChange \nDec 24 \n  \n  \n  \nBasic scenario (assumption no change) \n392.7 \n0.0 \n0.0 % \nParallel upward shock \n439.0 \n46.3 \n11.8 % \nParallel downward shock \n300.6 \n-92.1 \n-23.5 % \nSteepener shock with a curve that becomes steeper \n339.0 \n-53.7 \n-13.7 % \nFlattener shock with a curve that becomes flatter \n436.9 \n44.2 \n11.3 % \nUpward shock in the case of short-term interest rates \n448.4 \n55.7 \n14.2 % \nDownward shock in the case of short-term interest rates \n279.8 \n-112.9 \n-28.7 % \n \n"}

As at the end of 2024, the maximum present value loss in the non-trading book of the \nSteiermärkische Sparkasse Group amounted to EUR 117.7  million (3.52% of the Tier I capital). As at 31.12.2023, the \npresent value loss of the -200 base point interest shock amounted to EUR 148.7 million (5.3% of the Tier I capital). \nThe increase in the present value loss can be attributed, among other things, to changes in the statement of financial \nposition structure, adjusted models and methods as well as movements in the EUR interest curve. \nAnalysis of market risk \nInterest rate risk in the non-trading book \nThe risk of a change in interest is the risk of negative changes on the economic value or on the net interest yield due \nto changes in the interest environment. This risk arises when mismatches exist between assets and liabilities, including \nderivatives, in respect of their maturities, the timing of interest rate adjustments, the basic risk and the option risk. \nTo determine the interest risk, all financial instruments, including the off-balance-sheet ones, are used to determine \nthe effect of certain interest scenarios on the present value and on the net interest yield. Limits and threshold values \nare implemented for both perspectives of the risk of a change in interest rates of the non-trading book, the change in \nthe present values and the changes in the net interest yield. Positions without contractually fixed term or adjustment \nof interest rates, such as sight deposits and overdrafts, are modelled. For positions in which the customer has the \nright to make early payments advance payment models are used. \nTaking into account the internal Model Risk Management Policy and regulatory requirements, all material behavioural \nmodels were updated in 2024. The revision incorporates, among others, the extension of the historical observation \nperiod so that now also the current interest development and account-specific information are incorporated into the \nmodels. \nFor the in-house calculation of the risk and for the interest risk measurement under supervisory law, the maximum \ninterest rate change downwards is applied pursuant to Article 4 (k) of the EBA Regulatory Technical Standard on the \nsupervisory outlier tests (EBA/RTS/2022/10) and pursuant to Article 3 (7) of the Commission Delegated Regulation \n(EU) 2024/856. Due to the increased interest rates, particularly in the currencies EUR and MKD, however, these floors \nare increasingly becoming irrelevant. \nCredit spread risk \nThe credit spread risk is the risk of the negative change in the market value of financial instruments based on changes \nin the market price for the credit risk, the liquidity and the change in other potential characteristics of instruments that \nhave a credit risk. The Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group is exposed to credit spread risk in connection with its \nsecurities portfolio in the non-trading book. \nThe calculation of the credit spread risk for the securities of the non-trading book is done on the basis of a historical \nsimulation. In the process, the maximum (hypothetical) loss in value which can occur as the result of credit spread risk \nfactors over a period of time of one year is determined. The calculation is based on credit spread sensitivities (CR01) \nand Z-Spreads are used as risk factors for government bonds and corporate benchmark bond curves for corporate \nbonds.

The result is used in the ICAAP \ncalculations to establish the corresponding Pillar 2 capital backing for the non-trading portfolio. \nFor non-trading positions, the risk of a change in the spread (derived from historical data) of an instrument will in \nfuture be calculated, under the assumption of the same credit rating classification, i.e., how the credit spread moves \nwithin a certain credit rating classification / a certain default probability, with regard to the economic value (present \nvalue) or the net interest yield. \nExchange rate risk \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group is exposed to different types of exchange rate risks. These incorporate both \nrisks from outstanding foreign currency positions as well as other exchange rate-related risks. \nRisks from outstanding foreign currency items are exchange rate risks that develop from an incongruence between \nassets and liabilities or currency-related financial derivatives. These risks have their origin in customer-related \ntransactions or proprietary trading and are subject to daily monitoring and control. Foreign currency risk exposure is \nsubject to regulatory and internal limits. The internal limits are determined by the Team ALM.  \nThe following table shows the outstanding foreign currency items of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group on the \nreporting dates indicated (without structural foreign currency items from participating interests in foreign subsidiaries). \nin EUR million \nDec 24 \nDec 23 \nBosnian Mark (BAM) \n49.7 \n26.7 \nPound Sterling (GBP) \n0.1 \n0.3 \nJapanese Yen (JPY) \n0.0 \n0.1 \nMacedonian Denar (MKD) \n3.9 \n12.4 \nSwiss Franc (CHF) \n0.7 \n0.6 \nUS Dollar (USD) \n3.8 \n1.2 \nOther currencies \n0.5 \n0.4 \nTotal \n58.9 \n41.7 \n \nThe increase in the open items results primarily from the domestic currency Bosnian Mark (BAM) of the foreign \nparticipation Sparkasse Bank d.d. BiH. \nThe total risk amount for foreign currency risks additionally takes into account structural foreign exchange items from \nparticipating interests in foreign subsidiaries. \nEquity risk \nEquity risk describes the sensitivity of assets, liabilities and financial instruments to changes in the amount or the \nvolatility of market prices of equities. The Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group’s limit of a maximum of 2.0% of the \nsecurities portfolio was not exceeded in 2024.  \nHedging \nTo reduce the risks from changes in interest rates, selected customer positions or own issues are hedged using \nderivative instruments (swaps). The steering body responsible for the management of the risk of a change in interest \nrate is the Team ALM, and the higher-level Performance team. \nPursuant to the goals of the risk management, the hedging activities are concentrated on the two main control \nparameters – the interest rate on the one hand and the market value risk on the other. In the broader sense, \"hedging\" \nmeans a commercial activity to reduce risks but does not necessarily justify a security relationship pursuant to the \nrelevant IFRS provisions. If possible, hedge accounting according to IFRS is used to avoid measurement mismatches \nas a result of hedging activities. Within the framework of the securities statement of financial position accounting \ncompliant with IFRS, cashflow hedges, fair value hedges and net investment hedges are used. If necessary, hedges \nwithin the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group are used to hedge the risk of a change in interest rates or to hedge the \ncurrency risk.  \n"}

Liquidity risk \nDefinition and overview \nThe liquidity risk is viewed by the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group in accordance with the principles of the Basel \nCommittee for Banking Supervision and the European and Austrian statutory boundary conditions Regulation (EU) \n575/2013, Regulation (EU) 2015/61 and Bank Risk Management Regulation (KI RMV) in the respectively valid version. \nAccordingly, a differentiation is made between the market liquidity risk, i.e. the risk that the companies of the \nSteiermärkische Sparkasse Group are unable, due to insufficient market depth or due to market disruptions, to close \na position, and the refinancing risk, i.e. the risk that the banks in the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group will be unable \nto efficiently meet expected or unexpected obligations from current and future cashflows and securities, without \nimpairing their day-to-day business or the financial situation of the Group members. \nRefinancing risk is further divided into insolvency risk and structural liquidity risk. The former is the short-term risk \nthat current or future payment obligations cannot be met in full, in a timely manner and in an economically justified \nway, whereas the structural liquidity risk denotes the long-term risk of losses due to a change in the refinancing costs \nor the spread of the Group. \nLiquidity strategy \nCustomer deposits remained the primary refinancing source of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group in 2024 too. The \nvolume of customer deposits increased at the end of the year to EUR 16,733.4 million (2023: EUR 15,979.9 \nmillion); this equates to 74.4% of the balance sheet total. The loan-to-deposit ratio (extended to include certificated \ndeposits to customers excl. banks) is 88.2%.  \nThe liquidity strategy of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group for 2024 was successfully implemented. The \nfundamental points of the liquidity strategy include: \n reinvestment strategy: holding of a sufficiently high High Liquid Assets securities portfolio to manage the regulatory \nand in-house liquidity key performance indicators – collateral management \n Appropriate term structure with the new inclusion of liquidity (interbank monies) \n Floating of issues to customers \n Control of the regulatory and in-house liquidity key performance indicators Liquidity Coverage Ratio, Net Stable \nFunding Ratio, Survival Period Analysis and Structural Liquidity Ratio \n Managing the modified loan-to-deposit ratio \n Managing the nostro account management \n Managing and reporting the early-warning indicators defined in the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group’s emergency \nplan (negative publicity, distance to insolvency, survival period analysis, development of savings deposits, NPL \ncoverage ratio and modified loan-to-deposit ratio). \nIn 2024, around EUR 152.2 million in bonds were issued to customers for sale. The emission volume was thus lower \nthan the volume of returns or buybacks.  \nLiquidity ratios \nThe regulatory liquidity ratios of the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) are firmly \nestablished in the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group. The LCR in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2015/61 and the \nNSFR in accordance with Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 in the respectively current version are calculated in the \nSteiermärkische Sparkasse Group. \nThe LCR is calculated on individual bank level on a daily basis and reported to the banking authority every month. In \naddition, the NSFR is calculated monthly and sent to the supervisory authority on a quarterly basis.  \nBoth the LCR and the NSFR are part of the internal Risk Appetite Statement (RAS). The limits in the RAS have been \ndefined accordingly to guarantee an LCR and NSFR comfortably above the regulatory limit of 100%. \n"}

This analysis indicates the maximum period of time that a bank can survive in various \ndefined scenarios, including a difficult combined systemic and company-specific crisis, with the inclusion of liquid \nassets. The underlying assumptions incorporate drastic restrictions with regard to the availability of short-term and \nlong-term capital market financing with simultaneous significant outflows of customer deposits. In addition, an \nincreased use of guarantees and credit commitments per customer group is simulated and the possible additional \noutflow of securities from secured derivatives in stress scenarios is modelled. The SPA covers a stress period of up to \n12 months and is calculated on a weekly basis on individual bank level. \nThe \"structural liquidity gaps\" of Steiermärkische Sparkasse and of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group are regularly \nreported and monitored using the internal liquidity ratio \"Structural liquidity ratio\" (STRL). The STRL is calculated on a \nmonthly basis on individual bank level. \nAll aforementioned metrics (LCR, NSFR, SPA and STRL) are regularly reported to the Team ALM and to the \nManagement Board. The concentration risk with regard to the financing structure and the counterbalancing capacity \n(CBC) is regularly monitored and reported to the regulator for Steiermärkische Sparkasse. The “Funds Transfer Pricing” \n(FTP) of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group is used as a management instrument for the management of the \nstructural liquidity risk. \nMethods and instruments to reduce risk \nIn addition to the regular liquidity reports to the Team ALM and the Group Management Board, the FTP (Funds Transfer \nPricing) system is another important instrument for managing the liquidity risk within the Steiermärkische Sparkasse \nGroup. As the planning of funding requirements for liquidity management is of fundamental importance, a detailed \noverview of the funding requirements for the planning period for the entire Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group is \nprepared regularly.  \nThe comprehensive crisis plan of Steiermärkische Sparkasse ensures the coordination of all parties involved in the \nliquidity risk management in the event of a crisis; the latter is updated on a continuous basis.

Operational risk \nIn compliance with Article 4 Paragraph 1 Number 52 of Regulation (EU) No. 575/2013 (CRR), the Steiermärkische \nSparkasse Group defines the operational risk (OpRisk) as the risk of losses that can result from human error, \ninsufficient or erroneous in-house processes and systems or through external events, including legal risks. Non-\nfinancial risks (NFR) include both operational risk and reputation risk. The operational risk appetite of the \nSteiermärkische Sparkasse Group determines the limits and escalation stages in compliance with the risk strategy of \nthe Group for the entering into risks within the framework of the business activity. The OpRisk rules are a modular, \nnetworked and comprehensive approach that is integrated into the management and risk management system of the \nbanks and of the Group. The OpRisk rules meet the internal risk management and external regulatory requirements. \nOrganisation and governance \nThe tasks of the Operational Risk Management are derived from the “three lines of defence model”. The daily \nmanagement of the operational risk is the main responsibility of the line management. The line management is \nresponsible for the identification, valuation and management of the risk of products, activities, processes and systems. \nThe organisational unit “Strategic Risk Management” controls the group-wide management of the operational risk \nindependently, identifies risks and reports on them on a group level. The NFR function defines the NFR framework and \npromotes a consistent system for the Group. \nThe Local Operational Risk Committee (LORCO) responds to strategic topics that could have a significant impact on \nthe NFR profile, serves as a coordination platform for risk decisions with regard to non-financial risks and decides on \nmeasures or escalations to the Management Board of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group. \n"}
{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 139, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n138\nNon-financial risk rules and quantification \nSince 2009, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group has used the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) and in part \nthe Basic Indicator Approach (BIA). \nThe operational risk rules comprise various elements of the AMA. The risk identification is done through the recording \nof internal loss data, scenario analyses and key risk indicators (KRI) to measure the changes in the risk level. Risk \nindicators are reviewed periodically in order to recognise risk potential for losses early on. The process of risk \nidentification includes the identification of new risk types, risk drivers or a risk increase. The risk valuation is a \ncontinuous process by the line management that proactively identifies relevant non-financial risks, analyses and \nevaluates the effectiveness of the checks for reduction and evaluates the remaining risks. This applies both for the \noperation and for the change in the bank processes (e.g., approval of new processes, outsourcing). The line \nmanagement evaluates the risks in accordance with the effect of the extent of the damage and reports the residual \nrisks to the corresponding escalation lines for risk management. The level of the non-financial risks is determined \nbased on a risk scaling matrix that determines the categorisation for the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group. The risk \nmonitoring of corrective measures is done on a regular basis. The regular risk reporting offers detailed information for \nthe business and risk management units, the company management and the Management Board, above all the semi-\nannual Group OpRisk Report that informs about the most recent losses, the loss development, NFR decisions, risk \nindicators, key performance indicators and the VaR of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group for operational risks. \nBanks that follow the Basic Indicator Approach (BIA) have in-house instruments for the recording of loss data, for the \napproval of new products and outsourcing.  \nIn the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group, the regulatory and economic capital requirements for operational risk are \nmeasured in two ways. At Steiermärkische Sparkasse, the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) is used and in the \nsubsidiary banks the Basic Indicator Approach (IBA). The basis for the calculation of the BIA capital requirement is the \nthree-year average of the gross income that is multiplied by a flat rate of 15%. Pursuant to the AMA, the required \ncapital is calculated based on an in-house VaR model, taking into account in-house data, external data (Operational \nRisk data exchange Association consortium data), scenario analysis, business environment and in-house risk control \nfactors. The AMA capital calculation is based on the loss distribution approach. The individual distributions of the \ndamage frequency and the damage severity are calculated and determined with the aid of the Monte Carlo simulation \nfor loss distribution.   \nIn addition, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group received the permission to use the Group insurance programme \nincluding the company’s own insurance subsidiary (Erste Reinsurance s.a.) for the risk transfer and the consideration \nas the “Mitigant” in the calculation of the capital receivable within the framework of the AMA. \n \n \n"}

Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group as a lessor \nOn the lessor side, a differentiation is made between financing leasing and operating leasing relationships. Financing \nleasing is a leasing relationship that basically transfers all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset. \nIn financing leasing, the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group reports a receivable from the lessee under “Financing \nleasing receivables”. The receivable corresponds to the present value of the contractually agreed payments taking \ninto account any residual values. Interest income from receivables is recorded in the income statement in the item \n“Other similar income” under “Interest surplus”. \nFor operating leases, which are not financing leasing relationships, leased assets are reported under “Property, plant \nand equipment” or “Investment property” and depreciated according to the principles that apply to the respective \nassets. Lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease in the income statement under \n“Rental income from investment property and other operating leases”. \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group reduces the risks from all and any rights that it retains to the underlying assets. \nThis is achieved in particular through residual value guarantees, variable leasing payments in cases in which agreed \nupper thresholds are exceeded, and repurchase agreements with third parties. \nThe overwhelming majority of the leasing relationships for which the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group is the lessor \nare financing leasing. \nFinancing leasing \nThe Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group leases movables under financing leasing.

The incremental borrowing rate for moveable assets consists of basic \nEuribor, adjusted for mark-ups on the basis of the company’s rating, the exposure, the term and the collateral. The \nincremental borrowing rate for properties consists of two components: the market interest rate and the interest rate \nfor the individual property. The market interest rate takes into account the term, credit rating and basic Euribor, and is \nderived from existing bank data. The interest rate for the individual property is a mark-up on the market interest rate \nand is based on the quality of the individual property.

The amount of severance pay is dependent on the number of years of service and the respective wage or \nsalary at the time of the end of employment. There is a defined contribution system for employees whose employment \nbegan after 31 December 2002. The payments to the external employee pension fund are recorded as expenses. \nAnniversary bonuses are one-off special payments determined in the collective agreement, dependent on the \nremuneration and years of service with the company, under the prerequisite of a certain minimum duration of the \nemployment relationship. \nPursuant to IAS 19, pension and severance payment obligations qualify as payments after termination of the \nemployment relationship, whereas anniversary bonuses constitute other payments to employees due in the long term. \nObligations under defined benefit employee pension plans are calculated using the projected unit credit method.

Loan \ncommitments are generally not indicated in the statement of financial position before they are utilised. If it is probable \nthat the bank will conclude the loan agreement, the fees received will be accrued and adjust the effective interest rate \nof the loan when the commitment is utilised.

The recovery amount is based on a best-possible estimate. The resulting provision is EUR 11.4 \nmillion. \nProvision for leased employees (onerous contracts)  \nA provision for leased employees is formed for future ongoing personnel expenses for employees who cannot be \ndismissed due to collective agreements or de facto regulations and who can no longer be used directly in bank \noperations for the provision of bank operations services.  \nAs the unavoidable costs of meeting the contractual obligations to these employees exceed the economic benefits, \nthey are onerous contracts in accordance with IAS 37. \nProvisions for leased employees are formed for the employees who are leased to companies (service companies) \noutside of the consolidated group of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group and for whom only a partial remuneration \nof the actual salary costs is made by these service companies pursuant to the existing agreements. The amount of \nthe provision is calculated as the present value of the current deficit until the earliest possible retirement date for \nthese employees. The provisions are determined applying a uniformly estimated discount for fluctuation and early \nretirement and/or readmission into the direct bank operations. A discount rate of 3.35% is used to calculate the \npresent value. The parameters will be reviewed in future and adapted to any changes in circumstances. \nProvision for restructuring measures  \nIn the years 2014/2015, there were comprehensive discussions between the management, works council and \nworkforce at Steiermärkische Sparkasse with regard to a comprehensive new regulation of the remuneration system \nand in this context also with regard to an adjustment of the personnel capacities to the future personnel requirements. \nWithin the framework of these discussions, models were also developed that make provision for employees ending \ntheir employment relationship with Steiermärkische Sparkasse already before they start their standard pension by \nmutual agreement. Agreements have been reached with the employees affected and identified individually. Partial \nretirement agreements remain a possibility in individual cases. A corresponding restructuring provision was recognised \nfor the expenses resulting from this.  \n \n \n"}

Contingent liabilities \nIn order to correspond the financial requirements of the customers, the bank is concluding various irrevocable \nobligations and contingent liabilities.

It is not expected that the outcome of these proceedings will have a \nsubstantial negative effect on the financial and/or earnings situation of Steiermärkische Sparkasse or the \nSteiermärkische Sparkasse Group. The Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group is also currently involved in the following \nproceedings, of which some with a negative outcome could have an impact on the financial situation or the earnings \nof Steiermärkische Sparkasse or some of its subsidiaries. The presentation of possible financial effects is waived as a \nreliable estimate cannot be done either with regard to the duration or the outcome of the respective proceedings and \nso as not to influence the outcome of the respective proceedings.  \nIn Croatia, the Supreme Court decided in a lawsuit brought by a consumer protection organisation against several \nlocal banks, among them the Erste Bank Croatia (\"class action\") in 2015 that foreign currency clauses in credit \ncontracts with consumers are valid, whereas contractual provisions were declared void in the form that they were \nused in by most banks up until 2008 and were used as a basis for the unilateral change in variable interest of consumer \nloans denominated in Swiss francs. At the end of 2016, the Croatian Supreme Court of Justice rescinded the part of \nthe decision by the Supreme Court of Justice that established the lawfulness of the foreign currency clause. After the \ncase with regard to the foreign currency clause was referred back to the court of second instance for a new hearing, \nthis court essentially declared in 2018 that the CHF currency clause was invalid and that it violated collective and \nindividual rights of consumers.  \nEven before the previously mentioned class action, Erste Bank Croatia was required in 2015, due to a law that was \nissued, to offer conversion that made it possible for consumers to convert their loans denominated in CHF into loans \ndenominated in EURO based on corresponding conversion agreements. A certain number of CHF loans that were taken \nout in the period between 2004 and 2008 are the subject of individual court proceedings initiated by consumers who \nare invoking a partial invalidity of their original loan contract and demanding reimbursement, although the \ncorresponding conversion has been carried out. A definitive legal assessment on the question of any reimbursement \nclaims for denominated loans is currently being checked at the level of the Austrian Supreme Court. Due to the \nuncertainty regarding the definitive legal assessment and the ongoing non-uniform legal practice of the courts in \nCroatia with regard to converted loans, existing provisions for individual cases have been adjusted accordingly. \nAt Sparkasse Bank AD Skopje there are lawsuits from 2020 from small shareholders that relate to the capital increase \nfor EUR 10 million and individual resolutions that were approved in two general meetings. \nOtherwise, there were no fundamental outstanding lawsuits as of the reference date for the statement of financial \nposition. \n"}

In addition to the Steiermärkische Sparkasse, this includes two banks and five companies valued at \nequity. The consolidated group of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group can be seen in Note 62 “Depiction of the \nshareholding”.  \nAs a result of the joint liability scheme agreement and the associated support services of the members, an ex-ante \nfund was set up in 2014. This fund is managed by the civil law company IPS GesbR. The fund assets, until 31 \nDecember 2031, the members of the IPS have to build up the target endowment, are tied and are available solely for \nthe coverage of default events at members of the Joint Liability Scheme. IPS GesbR was included in the consolidated \ngroup of Erste Group in 2014. \n53.  Subsidiaries \nA subsidiary is a company that is controlled by another company. All direct and indirect associates that are under the \ncontrol of Steiermärkische Sparkasse are fully consolidated in the consolidated  financial statements. The fully \nconsolidated subsidiaries will be incorporated into the consolidated financial statements on the basis of their annual \nfinancial statements drawn up by 31 December 2024. \nNon-controlling interests represent the share of total comprehensive income and net assets not directly or indirectly \nattributable to the owners of Steiermärkische Sparkasse. Non-controlling interests are presented separately in the \nconsolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the consolidated \nstatement of financial position within equity.  \nControl \nAssessing whether an investee is controlled requires substantial judgements, assumptions and estimates, especially \nin non-standard situations, such as when: \n the power is based both on voting rights and on contractual agreements (or predominantly the latter); \n Risks of or entitlements to variable return flows from a commitment to an investment company that result from \nbalance sheet investments as well as off-balance sheet obligations and guarantees (or predominantly from the latter) \nor from easily identifiable income streams (such as dividends, interest, commissions) and cost savings but also from \nscale effects and/or other operational synergies (or predominantly from the latter). \nSteiermärkische Sparkasse Group has carried out an assessment to what extent in the case of an investment fund \nwhich is managed by Steiermärkische Sparkasse control exists and this is subsequently to be included in the \nconsolidated group. The assessment was done on the basis that the power to dispose over this investment fund is \nbased on a contractual agreement by which Steiermärkische Sparkasse is designated the fund manager. In addition, \nSteiermärkische Sparkasse has arrived at the conclusion that the risk from variable return flows is to be classified as \nfundamental as in addition to management fees a 100% stake in the investment fund is held. Moreover, \nSteiermärkische Sparkasse in its function as fund manager and the associated power to dispose over the associate, \nalso has the possibility to influence the variable return flows of the investment fund.

{"doc": "annual-financial-report-2024", "page": 175, "text": " \nANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT 2024 – STEIERMÄRKISCHE SPARKASSE GROUP \n174\nNSFR \nThe net stable funding ratio was established as part of Basel III and is intended to optimise the structural liquidity of \nbanks with regard to a time horizon of one year. The NSFR is defined as the ratio of available stable funding and the \namount for which stable funding is required. \nRisk Appetite Statement (RAS) \nThe RAS is a strategic declaration that determines the maximum risk that a company is willing to take for the attainment \nof the company’s goals. \nRisk categories \nRisk categories classify the risk positions of the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group based on the internal ratings of the \nGroup There are three risk categories for risk positions that are not non-performing and a risk category for non-\nperforming risk positions.  \nRisk category – Low risk \nTypical regional customers with a stable, long-standing relationship with the Steiermärkische Sparkasse Group or \nlarge, internationally renowned customers. Very good to satisfactory financial situation; low probability of occurrence \nof financial difficulties compared to the respective market in which the customers operate. Retail customers with a \nlong-standing business relationship to the bank or customers who use a broad range of products. No relevant payment \narrears currently or in the last twelve months. New business is typically performed with customers in this risk category. \nRisk category – Requiring comment \nPotentially liable non-retail customers who perhaps already had payment arrears/defaults in the past or could have \ndifficulties in the repayment of debts in the medium term. Retail customers with possible payment problems in the \npast that led to an early reminder. These customers recently demonstrated good payment behaviour. \nRisk category – Increased risk \nThe borrower is prone in the short term to negative financial and economic developments and has an increased default \nprobability. In some cases, restructuring measures are impending or have already been carried out. Such receivables \nare usually handled in specialised risk management departments. \nRisk category – non-performing \nAt least one of the default criteria according to Article 178 CRR applies to the borrower, among others, full repayment \nimprobable, interest or capital repayments of a fundamental receivable overdue by more than 90 days; debt \nrestructuring with loss for borrower; realisation of a loss or opening of insolvency proceedings. For all customer \nsegments, including retail customers, the customer perspective is applied when a customer defaults in a transaction, \nthen the transactions in which the customer has not defaulted  are also deemed to be non-performing. In addition, \nnon-performing receivables also include deferred transactions with payment arrears in which the customer has not \ndefaulted. \nInterest margin \nInterest surplus in percentage of the average interest-bearing assets. The average is calculated on the basis of annual \nfigures (average from statement of financial position and previous year). \nInterest-bearing assets \nTotal assets less cash in hand and balances, derivatives – held for trading, fixed assets, real estate held as a financial \ninvestment, intangible assets, current and deferred tax receivables, and other assets.  \n \n"}
